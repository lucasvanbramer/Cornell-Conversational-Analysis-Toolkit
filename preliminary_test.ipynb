It was occupied on July 11, 2002 by Moroccan police and troops, who were evicted without bloodshed by Spanish naval forces. On July 20, 2002, Spain agreed to withdraw its troops from the island.\", replacing it by a large account reasoning that the Spanish have absolutely no claim to this island.I think the (detailed) information is not from an Neutral point of view, although I am not in a position to check the complete factual accuracy (no sources are given).One thing I have found that is not accurate: the added material claims that \"Spain which has never occupied the Leila (=Perejil) islet\".On the Dutch site  I found the bit \"Toen Marokko in 1956 onafhankelijk werd van Spanje behield Madrid de zeggenschap over de enclaves Ceuta en Melilla en enkele eilandjes voor de kust. Het lot van het Peterselie Eiland bleef ook toen onduidelijk. Spanje haalde uiteindelijk begin jaren zestig zijn laatste soldaten van het eiland, maar beschouwt dit kennelijk niet als een overdracht aan Marokko.\" - which tells that Spain did keep soldiers on this island until the 1960s.And a piece from the African home site  \"The small, one kilometer-wide, island of Perejil is located just about 200 meters from the Moroccan coast inside Moroccan territorial waters. It is said to have belonged to Spain since 1668 but Morocco disputes this on historical grounds, arguing that the island was liberated from the Spanish protectorate in 1956 and adding that it was not the first time that Morocco conducted such military exercises on the island, which is customarily used by Moroccan farmers for farming and cattle-breeding activities.\"I think the information of 193.136.200.43 gives the arguments Morocco is using, but also the other side of the story should be added, and there should be something stating that the island is disputed, and the piece of the 2002 incidents should be added again.Edits:(cur) (last) . .

            "Has anyone seen this, one of the most recent pages of Search Engine Watch, of 10 Feb. by Chris Sherman, their editor?http://searchenginewatch.com/searchday/03/sd0210-wikipedia.htmlVery interesting and all about Wikipedia. 18:42 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)Could someone with editing right on main page please change Bosanskom to Bosanski (as it is correct usage). Feb 14, 2003 (UTC)Done  00:29 Feb 15, 2003 (UTC)Happy late Valentines Day, everyone!!Could we get Global protests against war on Iraq in Recent Events, please? - It's related to the already listed U.S. Plan to invade Iraq so it is covered by that. I dunno, Mav. I think if the US abruptly declared war, or Saddam Hussein got assassinated, or something, we'd probably put it in Recent Events, right? I think punctual, important events are worthwhile in Recent Events even if they are somehow subsumed into an ongoing story. - Yes it would be a big - yet very notable - bummer if Dubya was assassinated. Then people wouldn't have nearly as many excuses to hate Americans. I see your point. Hmmnn who is 'Dubya'? And by the way, cant wait for some type of marker to be back!! Patience, Antonio, Patience..LOL''''...lol!King George 'Dubya' Bush Someone needs to check on the Hizballah page. Im not sure if there is a copyright violation there.''''Been there. See talk page. I suggest add the ja: (japanese ) link to wikipedia main page.done. Just noticed it says \"العربية (Araby)\". Don't actually know any arabic, but wouldn't \"العربية\" be \"Al araby\", and \"Araby\" be \"عربية\"? (Not sure what the ة is for.)  13:51 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC)I think an arabic page it´s a good idea. That is the ISO abbreviation for the language??The top of the page and the side of the page disagree on Polish: Polska vs. Polski.  19:04 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC) I think it should be '''Polski''', as both places refer to language. If any refered to 'polish version', then it would be '''Polska'''.  19:42 Feb 26, 2003 (UTC)I suggest add the ia: (interlingua) link to wikipedia main page.  , 2003 Feb 24How about adding Timelines to \"Other Category Schemes\", since this is a way of accessing a lot of wikipedia information. Feb 24 2003Done.  03:34 Feb 25, 2003 (UTC)Iraq crisis, 2003 is a new top level for the various articles on this hot subject.  U.S. plan to invade Iraq is only one element of this crisis.  Credibility of the UN Security Council, role of weapons inspectors, precedents for North Korea and Iran in the \"Axis of Evil\", Blair's continuing as PM of the UK despite Labour Party opposition, fate of publicly owned oil infrastructure and rights in Iraq, fate of Baath party, NATO splits, Turks' role in Kurdistan, etc., are all involved.  Also, the second that the war is either started or avoided, the \"U.S. plan to invade Iraq\" will become quite irrelevant - it will either *be* a war (not a \"plan\") or it will just be a 'crisis' that Saddam is stil sitting there, or Baath still sitting there, or that the UN looks effective or ineffective, or that the Turks invade Mosul... whatever happens, the UN is already using the term 'humanitarian crisis', so that word 'crisis' is in play.The new article is focused on listing the various impacts discussed in the news and the other articles.  It has a timeline only for future events, and could link to a timeline of past events if we want to assemble that.  It links to all the other articles I could find.  It takes a likely-impact view not a who-supports-the-present-US-plan view.If you agree with these changes please help with the article and then add Iraq crisis, 2003 to the Main Page to replace U.S. plan to invade Iraq.I agree that U.S. plan to invade Iraq is too specific but Iraq crisis, 2003 needs to be developed more before it replaces U.S. plan to invade Iraq in the Selected Articles section. Working on it.  Need help.  Current events such as Turkey/Kurd conflict and UK Labour Party revolt now covered in timeline.  New current events should go to Iraq crisis, 2003 first, and then their long term impact can be assessed and other articles updated.Also, War on Terrorism and Israeli-Palestinian conflict and anti-war protests are of interest now mostly because of the Iraq crisis, and thus not having a proper top-level article is forcing other things off the ongoing events list.  For instance, the US decision to send combat troops to the Phillipines is a veyr important element of the War on Terrorism but is almost going unnoticed due to the Iraq noise.  Let's cast some light on these things while the mass media gets distracted by that noise.  And, let's clear room on the ongoign events bar for things that have nothing to do with the US, if that's possible.  Half the items on the ongoing events, at least, should be things that aren't of great interest to Americans, as a start.  It would be nice if we didn't give free publicity to wars that might not happen.I think the \"selected articles\" section looks better like this (withbold rather than italic headings); Selected Articles '''In the news''':WTC site - RI nightclub fire - Sami Al-Arian -Anti-war protests'''Recent deaths''': Mister Rogers -Jesica Santillan -Dolly the sheep -Kid Gavilan -Lou Harrison'''Ongoing events''':Israeli-Palestinian conflict -Plan to invade Iraq -War on Terrorism - North Korea'''Historical anniversaries''':Reichstag -WTC bombing -Nasser -Galerius -Gregorian CalendarMarbury v Madison -Johann Gutenberg -Emile Zola -Gulf War -Supernova 1987a -White RosePlease go ahead and edit Main Page/Temp to reflect your idea - we can then debate whether or not itis a good idea.  20:32 Feb 27, 2003 (UTC)I understand that DNA / Crick / Watson was 50 years ago today.  SGB 2003-02-28I thought it was on February 21? Please update the DNA article with your date.  It was an announcement on BBC breakfast news this morning. No other details.  SGB 2003-02-28Please add Roger Needham to recent deaths on the main page.   23:39 Mar 3, 2003 (UTC)Done.  00:17 Mar 4, 2003 (UTC)Is this a better place than VillagePump to place suggestions for changes to links on the main page (but not those only of current interest)?  For example, I suggested adding the By Alphabetical Order page, and I would also like to suggest that the main page change the List of reference tables or add a new link with the more familiar term Almanac (as a redirect) to help folks find it.  Thanks for listening.  -  21:06 Mar 5, 2003 (UTC)It is now 40 years to the month since Dr Beeching in Britain unveiled the plans to cut the UK's railway network, or the  Beeching axe Wouldent it be a good idea to put this in the historical anniversaries section.As it says on the top of this page all requests for listing items in the Selected Articles section should be directed to Wikipedia talk:Selected Articles on the Main Page. The guidelines for getting topics listed in the various parts of Selected Articles are at Wikipedia:Selected Articles on the Main Page. I suggest add automatically the  links in wikipedia to text written by the user in talk pages ( the user could include this option in preferences). Or, at least, create an autotext to include the user link when included in a talk page. How does this relate to the Main Page? It looks like you are talking about sigs, no? Just type three ~ and hit save for an automatic sig.  The ~~~ trick is described in wikipedia:how to edit a page (or click \"Editing help\" in any edit window). I didn´t know where ask the question and for me was neccessary to subscribe in the talk main page. Thank you a lot for the information.Moved from Wikipedia:Village pump:Thank you. Sorry but can do me a favor again? Put this to main page.[[af:HomePage]][[ar:HomePage]][[da:Forside]][[de:Hauptseite]][[en:Main Page]][[eo:%C4%88efpa%C4%9Do]][[es:Portada]][[fr:Accueil]][[it:HomePage]][[ko:대문]][[nl:Hoofdpagina]][[pl:Strona główna]][[ru:Main_Page]][[su:HomePage]][[zh:首页]]I found this list in ja wikipedia, which seems more comprehensive than current one.   03:43 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC)There already is a comprehensive list on the Main Page under the '''In Other Languages''' area. Some of the links you've listed are to wikis that don't even have a Main Page. Aside from Sudan, all of them have homepage I think. And it is quite convinient and normal to have language links.   05:24 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC)If we include some of the smaller wikis as interlanguage links on the Main Page then it would only be fair to include all of them. That would mean that people at 800 x 600 screen resolutions will be greeted not by content on the Main Page but by a screen full of language links. mavCan someone update: , so that there is more to choose from? Many gaps have been filled since last update. -I have generated an up to date list at Wikipedia:Most wanted articles.  18:32 Mar 7, 2003 (UTC)Thank you ever so much. -I have two questions. 1)re Bix - as it's the centenial of his birth, being marked internationally with concerts, radio shows, and at least two festivals, I thought it a worthy historical anniversary to mark. Mav, do we just have a difference of opinion, or is there a critiria that disqualifies it that I've missed? 2) the \"br\" hard return after Atom bomb.  Why? Are the items before the \"br\" in a different category than those below it? If so, perhaps there should be some indication of that in the text.  (The hard return just makes the text look out of balance to me.)   Cheers,   21:15 Mar 10, 2003 (UTC)Hm. 100 years... Since the celebration for it is current, this is more of a current event. The historical anniversaries is for events that were momentous when they happened.The br is to align the second line of historical anniversaries with the other lines right above it. If this is not done then the first line on historical anniversaries extends all the way to the right margin which is very ugly at higher than 800 x 600 screen resolution.  Thanks for your reply. I still have a problem with the second item. The br seems to be having a very different effect on my end: Historical aniversaries with 3 items on that first line, then just 1 item on the next line, with the remaining 3/4ths of the line blank line after the br, then another full line of items, then a fourth line with the last two items. That's with Opera. Okay,now I just looked with IE expecting it to look better, but I get the same thing except for 2 items on the second (with the br) of the four lines. I presume whatever you're trying to do depends on screen size or text size or browser. Might there be another way to do it which won't produce the problems I see?    21:45 Mar 10, 2003 (UTC)I don't know of any. From what you describe the ''whole'' Selected Articles'' table should have similar problems on each line. The lowest common denominator I use for the table are; 800 x 600 screen resolution, standard font sizes, maximized browser window with the sidebar enabled (this is more or less the industry standard for minimum specs and also represents the largest single group of net users). So anybody with a screen resolution that is less 800 x 600 (640 x 480 for example), or with larger than standard font sizes, will have less than great results. I need my counteeeeerrrrsssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!

After that, the systems have developed into much more advanced programs that let you use your hardware in very many ways. Here is a list with the biggest operating systems from the start: MS-DOS                  - 1975 Unix                    - 1983 Microsoft Windows       - 1985 Microsoft Windows 2.0   - 1987 Microsoft Windows 3.0   - 1990 Linux                   - 1991 Microsoft Windows NT    - 1994 Microsoft Windows 95    - 1995 Microsoft Windows 98    - 1998 Microsoft Windows 2000  - 2000 Microsoft Windows ME    - 2000 Microsoft Windows XP    - 2001 Lindows                 - 2002Several reasons for this: (i) it ignores mainframe and mini operating systems, from which microcomputer operating systems descend. (ii) it's ''way'' too short and selective - AppleDOS, CPM, Amiga, TRSDOS, etc., etc., etc. (iii) It dates MS-DOS to 1975 (6 years before the IBM PC!) and ignores the things it was cloned from. (iv) It lists one particular minor Linux distribution (Lindows) and ignores all others.In short, it needs a ''lot'' of work - and the end result would simply be to duplicate material that is already covered in greater depth and with more accuracy elsewhere.  22:59 Jan 29, 2003 (UTC)\n",

            "Hi Jurriaan,Thanks for the reply about the subdivisions of ''gemeenten'' on the Village Pump page. Since you appear to be the only Dutch person to have replied, perhaps I can probe you a bit more.For example, if you look at Nijmegen, the webpage http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/gem/gem344g.htm says that the gemeente comprisesPlaatsen, dorpen, gehuchten, stadsdelen (geen wijken)Lent Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Oosterhout Nijmegen, Ressen NijmegenThe questions this raises areAre the subdivisions listed (Lent Nijmegen, etc) official in any way, or will different people come up with different lists? Since those lists from the website above have been re-created in each Wikipedia article, then if they're not official, their value in each article is questionable.If the subdivisions (Lent Nijmegen, etc) ARE official, can each one be assigned to a different type (Plaatsen, dorpen, etc)? In other words, can one say for example that Lent Nijmegen is a stadsdeel, and Ressen Nijmegen is a dorp? Or is the list of types specified as ''Plaatsen, dorpen, gehuchten, stadsdelen (geen wijken)'' just to try to cover all sorts of subdivision a gemeente might have, in a general way?Hope you can answer these questions -)Just pop the answers below and put a little note on my page to say you've replied. Thanks.   \n",

            "These subdivisions are official. I find the term \"stadsdelen (geen wijken) a bit confusing since stadsdeel and wijk often mean the same. The best translation for \"stadsdeel\" would probably be district (it literally means part of the town/city) and \"wijk\" could be translated with either district or neighbourhood. Nijmegen is divided into 9 \"stadsdelen\" (Stadscentrum, Oud Oost, Oud West, Nieuw West, Midden Zuid, Zuidrand, Dukenburg, Lindenholt, Waalsprong) and 44 \"wijken\". Lent, Oosterhout, Ressen etc. are \"wijken\" but I guess they startet as villages around Nijmegen and as Nijmegen expanded are now part of Nijmegen. \"Plaatsen, dorpen, gehuchten, stadsdelen\" covers indeed all sorts of subdivision a gemeente (municipality) might have. See also http://www.nijmegen.nl/Wijkinformatie/index.asp If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask\n",

            "Ah, ik snap 'm -) But it's left me more confused about those lists from www.sdu.nl. So a few more questions (sorry!)Is every gemeente divided into stadsdelen, and then the stadsdelen divided into wijken? That's obviously the case for Nijmegen, but is it true for every gemeente in the Netherlands?Why does that list from www.sdu.nl specify \"Lent Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Oosterhout Nijmegen, Ressen Nijmegen\"?  That's one entry (\"Nijmegen\") that covers 41 wijken, and then the other 3 wijken (in just the stadsdeel of Waalsprong) are listed separately, despite the \"(geen wijken)\"! That makes no sense at all.If I look at Arnhem, the wiki article specifies the same as http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/gem/gem30g.htmArnhem, Elden, Schaarsbergenbut the stadsdelen are listed on http://www.arnhem.nl asstadsdeel 1 Binnenstadstadsdeel 2 Broek/Presikhaafstadsdeel 3 Noord Ooststadsdeel 4/5 Noord West (incusief Schaarsbergen, 5)stadsdeel 6 Oud Zuidstadsdeel 7 Elderveld de Laarstadsdeel 8 Vredenburg/Rijkerswoerdso again there's no correspondence. Elden and Schaarsbergen are just 2 out of the 24 wijken.Given all this, are those www.sdu.nl lists meaningful at all? They've been duplicated throughout the wiki articles, but I increasingly think that they're just a random list of places from within the gemeente, and don't reflect anything about the internal structure within the gemeenten. So is it worth leaving them in, or are they just misleading?  \n",

            "Hello Spellbinder,Only large (by Dutch standards of course -) ) cities ared divided into stadsdelen and those stadsdelen are divided into wijken. Smaller cities and towns, like where I grew up, are only divided into wijken.  That's why the word stadsdeel confused me a bit; most people refer to the wijk where they live, not to the stadsdeel. To make things even more complicated, wijken are sometimes divided into \"buurten\" (also translated with neighbourhood) which could comprise only a few streets. A gemeente must not necessarily include more plaatsen and can verry well be only one town.I must say I am quite puzzled as well. I don't think that all web pages are up to date. I'll try to explain what I found out. To my understanding, Oosterhout, Lent and Ressen are actually villages which until recently belonged to a different gemeente. They now belong to Nijmegen and are called wijken (these villages are in fact more or less integrated into Nijmegen). That would mean that the number of 44 wijken on www.nijmegen.nl is not correct (it should probably be 50 by now, see also: http://www.nijmegen.nl/Leven_in_Nijmegen/feitenencijfers/wijken_gebieden/wijken/index.asp). It would also mean that the sentence Plaatsen, dorpen, gehuchten, stadsdelen (not wijken) is not correct. It might be a standard expression that www.sdu.nl uses for all gemeenten. So a village can also be a wijk if it is close to the city. I would remove the link to www.sdu.nl and instead place a link to the homepage of the corresponding city/town/whatever. The same goes for Arnhem, i.e. Elden and  Schaarsbergen are now wijken of Arnhem (http://www.arnhem.nl/sites/internet_nieuw/internet_skeleton/Framework/index.html?ingang=wonen_leven&page;=http%3A//www.arnhem.nl/sites/internet_nieuw/wonen_leven/arnhem_per_wijk).Cheers\n",

            "For \"La Cour de cassation juge la forme et non le fond\",it could be \"The Cour de cassation judge form and not substance\". Maybe not the best translation possible, but I hope it make sense. It is a common saying. ''Fond'' (substance) means mostly facts here (that is what \"le juge du fond\" means in the Court's decisions, the judge that states the facts of the case, that is the lower court, and the Cour de cassation sticks to its findings). Then \"form\" might be somewhat weak, as it suggests procedure only, while it should means both procedure and substantive law. Indeed, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen states that \"The law is the overt expression of the general will\" (where law means parliament made law). As a consequence, the traditional doctrine is that judge should have no part in it (the current doctrine if there is such a thing seems to be much more willing to recognize that judges do create rules). It is true that procedure is the basis for most of the Court's decisions. Moreover, the Cours d'assises decisions, which get much attention, contains no reasoning, so they will not be annuled for reason of substantive law (maybe they could if the sentence was beyond what the law allows, I do not know if such a thing ever happended).However, the primary duty of the Court is to ensure a uniform interpretation of the law. And however comprensive the law codes might be, there are gaps that the court must fill, sometimes creatively. A famous and recent exemple is its 2000 ruling on the so called question of wrongful birth, the Perruche decision (BTW, it was the last time the Court was really in the news, so it is rather uncommon). The question was whether a child born with severe handicaps, after a medical analysis failed to diagnoses rubella in his then pregnant mother, could sue for damages. His parents had been awared damages, but they had also sued on their child's behalf and the Cour d'appel (Paris) had denied damages there. There is no know medical treatment that would have permitted, following a proper diagnosis, to avoid or limit his handicap, a proper diagnosis would only have allowed his mother to choose abortion. What is called the \"visa\", the law that the court names to ground its decisions is a very thin basis. It consists in articles 1165 and 1382 in the Civil Code, which states Art. 1165: Les conventions n'ont d'effet qu'entre les parties contractantes ; elles ne nuisent point aux tiers, et elles ne lui profitent que dans le cas prévu par l'article 1121 . Art. 1382:  Tout fait quelconque de l'homme, qui cause à autrui un dommage, oblige celui par la faute duquel il est arrivé, à le réparer.In english, that might sound like (improvements welcomed) Art 1165: Contracts have effects only between the parties to the contract. They do no harm to others, and profit them only as stated in article 1121 (1121 is irrelevant in this case)Art 1382: Anyone who causes a tort to someone else must make good of it.There is nothing obvious for or against the ruling in this. The decision contains virtually no reasoning (not unusual that). The court the case was first remanded to (Orléans) resisted the decision, which the Court stated again in assemblée plenière. Most doctrinal writers opposed the decisions too. It caused some upheaval, and the parliament quickly made a law to settle the question, voiding the court decision for the future ('no one may call being born a tort').This is just an example maybe an extreme one, to show that the court does not merely correct errors. I agree with you however that \"drastically changes\" sounds a bit strong, particularly if one compares with what the US supreme court does (Perruche is not Roe v. Wade).  00:08, 24 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n",

Moved from article. - Padri WarThe Padri War is the name given to the skirmishes fought by Dutch troops in the early 19th century in defence of its colonies (highly dependant on the half-annual shipment of salt. Slaves frequently went on the rampage destroying what was then known as \"the almighty freeborn association liver machine\", i.e., kettle plantations (kettle being a long-obsolete crop often grown by settlers because it was hardy and easy to grow). There ws no decisive outcome from this \"war\", as government forces frequently changed leadership and motives, parading under the phrase \"Credo in unum Duodenum\" (\"We follow one God\") whichever side they were one. The factions were arranged thus:Monarchists (large party)Influentialists (large party)Militants (small party)Meadowists (consisting mostly of one man and his dog)Obviously, no political unification was possible, so it was agreed buy every none-political body in the country that the Padri war would come about as a direct rescuent from the all-pervasive counter-melody given on Telemann. These factions were arranged as follows:G Clefs (fractional majority)F Clefs (fractional minority)C Clefs (those violas and trombones again)Percussion clefs (just hit them)Obviously, the meticulously observed tripartite structure of the Dutch Navy was no good amongst such divsions. Also, they were missing a baritone oboe player and a good bass clarinettist.It was around this time that the English dignitary Sir Lord howard Johnson sutch observed \"all I had to do was reach out and take it. The IT in question was ironic, and agnus dei, qui tollis peccata mundi was not without its reasons for destroying of the ancient oath of Salmanezer II\".Lord Johnson's ideals were instantly incorporated into the already Clef-divided Navy, so that now the forces were arranged thus:G clef Kyrie factionG clef Credo factionG clef Benedictus factionF clef Kyrie factionF clef Gaudeamus factionF clef Ite misse est factionF clef Sanctus factionC clef Love and Fear faction, lead by Jim Cunningham. \"Thankyou Jim Cunningham!\"So, in conclusion, THANKYOU JIM CUNNINGHAM!\n",

I'm assuming that you'll want to write photographic lens from a more practical point of view, and keep lens mostly as a theory of optics type article. Alternately, we could just make lens a disambiguation page, and move the articles to lens (optics) and lens (photography).

At second thought The picture show sensible vigneting this is typical of WA lenses with filters. if you want to fake a rainbow with a filter you need to use a WA to have a maximal depth of field). The angle of the rainbow with the ground seems unusual to me, could it vary with latitude for instance ? Is the shadow of the tree oriented  according to theory ? The shape of the bow is a circle centered on the shadow of the observer's head, so the visible part of the bow can be quite \"low\" if the sun is high in the sky.

My ''International directory of military aircraft'' does not support the move, and a quick Google doesn't either.  21:10 Feb 20, 2003 (UTC)Well someone began to rename the MiG entries in Mikoyan (instead of Mikoyan-Gurevitch). I find it was unaccurate. Do you think MiG is better ? 21:58 Feb 20, 2003 (UTC)That someone was me, Eric, quite some time ago. It was not a careless or casual decision. I gave ample notice of it in the appropriate talk:naming conventions pages (no-one ojected), and I went through and edited all the pages that linked to the pages I renamed. Considered in isolation, I'm not averse to MiG-17 as it's clear and unanbiguous, however all the other Soviet aircraft are in the form Manufacturer Ab-123 and it would be inconsistent to treat MiG and MiG alone differently. The design bureau is \"Mikoyan-Gurevich\" and this is indicated in the \"Mi\" and \"G\" parts of \"MiG\". The most common title of the ''aircraft'' however is plain \"Mikoyan\". The reference I cited above is very careful and accurate. I think it better to stick with that as a guide. Unless there is a good reason suggested not to do so, I'll name them back again. Hey, Eric. It's not worth it. It will just start a flame war and encourage people to put nasty comments on those pages too. Why risk more flame wars and edit wars?  03:21 Feb 21, 2003 (UTC)Eric, please don't make junk articles to prove a point. It's highly unlikely that the article in question will remain. Take a couple of deep breaths. )   03:27 Feb 21, 2003 (UTC)I don't mean to go further this article is anti-semite by the simple fact it exists. 03:31 Feb 21, 2003 (UTC)Eric,I have removed (but not deleted) the C-130 pic from the C-130 Hercules article. The reason is that I arrived at the article from the United States Air Force page and so I assumed (not correctly) that the pic should be a USAF plane. So I changed it. However, I think there are three improvements that might make it worth leaving mine in place  .....- Your pic was rather large. It would probably have made a rather narrow text channel for those who use 800 by 600 resolution (and who use Wikipedia with the options frame visible).- The article is entirely about the USAF Hercules, only a brief mention is made of the other 50 nations who have them.- I provide a thumbnail at 250 pixels wide and a large one at 750 pixels wide.So please can my pic stay? (but I will reinstate yours if you wish)  08:00 Apr 2, 2003 (UTC)You people believe Lir/Vera/Dietary Fiber/Susan/Adam?All I did was clarify this sentence pointed out by Dachshund: “As mentioned, the Soviets bore the heaviest casualties of World War II.  These war causalities can explain much of Russia's behavior after the war.”I added content. I did not delete content. Maybe some user prior do me deleted some content, but who knows. I wasn’t following the rest of the article, just this sentence pointed out by Dachshund.My parents were Holocaust survivors and my entire family apart from the two of them was eradicated. I demand an apology for all you users who believe that slander coming from that lunatic user who has been banned repeatedly. If the charges by this latest reincarnation of Lir have made it onto the mailing list, then I expect you people to correct these charges so that nobody is under the impression that I did this.Hi Eric!I would be very interested to know how you cut my tomcat.f14.250pix.jpg down from my 35K to your 12K. The quality appears to be still OK. Perhaps I could have compressed mine a lot more? I use Photoshop to do my graphics work. Thanks for your help. 20:27 Apr 12, 2003 (UTC)I've edited the picture mainly to remove a little black strip on the left. I use Paint Shop Pro not Photoshop, I simply have used a stronger compression than yours (I tuned it around 25) I  think you can do the same with Photoshop. 20:34 Apr 12, 2003 (UTC)Hi Eric! I ''hate'' to contradict Maury when it comes to engines, but, yes, it is very common to refer to a straight 4 as ''an in-line four''. As an example, I might say: \"The Ford Falcon has an in-line 6, where Holden Commodore has a 3.6 litre V-6.\" I used to read heaps of Australian and British car magazines in my 20s. The term \"in-line\" for a straight 6 (or 4 or 5 - whatever) is common in both Australian and English English. Maybe they don't say it that way in the US. Maybe Maurie made a mistake. Or maybe he knows something that I don't! I think the real answer, though, is that the term can have either meaning depending on context. Technically V and X and H engines are in-line, but you'd usually not use that term for them in general conversation, not unless you wanted to distinguish them from radials or rotaries. One more example, this time using \"in-line\" in the opposite sense: \"Many American fighters used radial engines, but most English fighters, like the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Tempest, used in-line engines.\"Clear as mud?Typical damn English language, isn't it. More words than any other language in the world, and we ''still'' use one word to mean two or three different things! Cheers, Well it's getting a real mess I think that a double radial can be viewed as an inline engine too. Hmmm... I first referred to the Straight engine as an inline (like the French en-ligne) then I moved it Straight. It seems also clear to now that in aviation inline is used for V and flat engine too. So I think we should clarify both senses in the article about inline. 15:04 Apr 13, 2003 (UTC)Hmmm .... I doubt the double radial thing, as the banks of cylinders are usually staggered for better cooling. Somebody made a 4 bank radial once, which had the cylinders in-line, if I remember correctly. But they could never work out how to stop the back cylinder heads warping - they got way too hot. But yes, a sentence or two added to appropriate articles is a good idea. I have never heard anyone say \"straight engine\" before. It is probably an American expression. We always say \"in line engine\" - but ''either'' \"straight 6\" or \"in-line 6\". Go figure.  TThe cylinders doesn't seem staggered on the double Wasp, I'm I wrong, look http://www.aviation-history.com/engines/pr-2800.htm 17:02 Apr 13, 2003 (UTC)As I indicated on Talk:Tintin, find me a source for the accusations of sexism in Tintin (e.g. a magazine article, a book, or a journal article), and I'll be happy to put the paragraph back in. Having read several books and articles about the strip, I haven't come across any such claim, so it smacks of bullshit to me.  Well I think the fact that Tintin was charged for sexism is a fact. Thus this should be discussed. But read my comments  on Talk:Tintin I think many comics before the seventies can be charged of sexism (and to be clear not only comics also advertising, movies, newspapers, politics.... were sexist by today standards, in France a complete equality of right between men and women was only achieved in the late seventies). But you also cuted much more why ?Can you please have a look to The ideology of Tintin this article is mainly based on comment I had wrote on Talk:Tintin IMO it needs a lot work and some others advice to make it NPOV. I'm somewhat reluctant to edit articles on some sensitive subjects because I'm not native-English speaking. 20:17 Apr 14, 2003 (UTC)I've been around for over a year now... but thanks anyway! -) 11:20 Apr 18, 2003 (UTC)Well it's never too late....Thanks for converting the ''Woman Who Did'' image. I've never been good at that sort of thing, and I usually don't look at how big a file is.   17:38 Apr 20, 2003 (UTC)Please do not add NPOV disputes to Wikipedia:Pages needing attention - please instead link them to wikipedia:NPOV dispute. Also, please date (and optionally sign) articles you add to the list.  21:36 May 12, 2003 (UTC)OK 21:41 May 12, 2003 (UTC)Iceland was independent since 1918. I hope you revert the distortion.   13:54 5 Jun 2003 (UTC)\"Iceland remained independent for over 300 years, and was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Limited home rule was granted in 1874, and independence followed in 1918. The Danish king remained the sovereign until 1944, when a republic was founded.\"I must have missed something, there's some contradiction. Why did the UK occupied Iceland just one day after the German occupied Denmark ? Had the Iceland full independance in its foreign policy ? 14:08 5 Jun 2003 (UTC) Sounds reasonable to me. Australia became independant but ''still'' has the Queen of England as the head of state. No-one cares too much. No-one with any brains, anyway. (Disclaimer: I am, in fact, a republican - i.e., I would get rid of the Australian Queen - as, roughly, priority number 9893 on my \"10,000 most important things to do this century\" list.) Is there an ongoing dispute there on Iceland still? If in doubt, ast JTDirl to run his eye over it: he's the expert in this area. Me? I'm OK at duck taxonomy. ) PS Regarding the British invasion. I seem to recall, now that my memory clicks into gear, that there was a complicated bit of political reasoning going on there, but the details escape me. JTD would probably know.The English and the Germans both raced for Narvik (for many reasons, control of Northern Atlantic and over winter-time Iron ore transports maybe the most prominent). The Germans won, but as a side effect the English captured Iceland in the process.   15:08 5 Jun 2003 (UTC)Re: The League of Gentlemen Fripp, et al band - you're right, it couldn't really be called \"early\". But it wasn't between the first and second KC - that ''would'' have been rather early (1970, since KC1 broke in 1969, and KC2 was formed later in 1970). The League of Gentlemen was actually around 1979/1980, just before the Belew/Levin/Fripp/Bruford lineup of 1981. Just in case you're curious )   02:14 7 Jun 2003 (UTC)It depends what you call the second KC... By the second KC I intended to design the re-birth of KC in 81. I agree with you that was just before. 16:01 7 Jun 2003 (UTC)Why have you stated that the Yerkes Observatory contains the world's largest telescope? Surely there is a larger one! It was well written (your English is better than my French anyway) and relevant. However, the same statement was made earlier in the article. You can restore it, however, later in the article under \"important events.\" This article requires a good deal of work, after all. Thanks for looking at it. Just so, Eric. I agree. Photo? Ahh .... my Blue-billed Duck. Yes, she is a cutie, isn't she.  THi Eric, you wrote:''you seem to forget that an a ccident is possible with only one car involved''no, it's just that I don't know enough English terms to make things clear -) For example, to the list of possible accidents I was going to add the possibility of a driver losing control and just going into a tree or a wall, but I don't know the generic term, and a modest amount of Googling didn't reveal it -)) -Given your conversation with , you may be interested in helping to improve common sense conservative.eh ! pour 5000 euros, j en ferais bien un troisieme de bébé ! -)moi aussi mais je suis pas sûr les toucher malgrés sa carte d'identité je ne pense pas que mon épouse soit française selon les critères du FN -(ah !

            "Would it be possible to have a convention on references where we site them within the text like so:  The convention (unwritten as far as I know) is to have naked wikirefs within the text that are then numbered. All other external links go in the External link section.  But how do we number them? If somebody adds one, its easy for all the numbers to get changed up. Also, it might be useful to have a link to an article on the source.Don't they automatically number themselves? Lemme try...   ... yep, they sure do.   22:50 22 Jul 2003 (UTC)But mav says not to do it that way...  or are those naked wikirefs? Which reminds me: Is there any way of inserting an anchor bar in Wiki text?  I've looked in obvious places like Manual of Style and Cite Your Sources, but it doesn't seem to be there.What I'm thinking of is the difficulty of citing specific material from a long printed source, meaning a book.  If you have several references, you don't want to repeat the whole gory bibliographic listing in each place.  If you put that in a Bibliography, there's the problem of putting a page reference in each place while linking it to the proper item in the bibliography.  I see that the Cite entry suggests a Wiki entry for the book itself; but is that really what you want for every work cited?  What I'd rather see is something like...not putting him to torture (NEL, pp. 400, 406).  On the other hand,...'''Bibliography'''NEL: Orio Giacchia, ''Nel Terzo centenario...'', Università Cattolica etc etcwhere a click on the NEL link would take you to the biblio item to find the publication data.  One could use this reference style without the hyperlink, as is done in many books, but that seems so twentieth-century. Any comments? 23:02 22 Jul 2003 (UTC)I personally like the [1] [2] citation style (the standard in many journals), with a bibliographic listing at the end.  Auto-hyperlinks and auto-numbering would be helpful, but would require code changes.  See Depleted uranium for an example of doing this manually, which has the problem of re-numbering your references when you add another one anywhere other than the end of the list.  23:13 22 Jul 2003 (UTC)Manual renumbering would be a major problem, absolutely. That sort of thing was behind my proposal to use abbreviations of the document name in place of numbers.  But I'm not proposing that somebody make code changes to support the anchor capability; just checking that it wasn't already there, obscurely.Naturally, when the footnote is one of several to pages in a book, I can write a full footnote with biblio data and page numbers in the first one, then use good old ''loc. cit.'' and ''op. cit.'' in the rest.  A pity, though, about having the numbering of footnotes set in stone as the order in which you created them and appended them to the numbered list.  Makes the auto-numbering of the list a dubious advantage: arguably, if you're manually numbering the [nnn] references, you should do the same to the footnote bodies, to reduce the chance of crossing them up.  Just rambling here, but it seems there might be reason to discuss a more automatic design for footnotes.  Should I be on some list or watching some page in order to keep up with any discussion that might arise? 01:17 23 Jul 2003 (UTC) Actually the naming sounds okay too, and that also is fairly common in journals.  Something like [Smith], or [Smith 1998] if disambiguating is necessary (the latter is sometimes used even when disambiguating isn't necessary if it's in a context where the date of the reference might be of particular importance).  That avoids the renumbering problem, without having to put full unwieldy citations in parentheticals.  Of course, I personally still prefer a standard footnote method (with superscript footnotes instead of [1]), but that would require the auto-numbering changes just like the [1] method would.  02:22 23 Jul 2003 (UTC)\n",

            "Yes, but you'd translate it into english as 'month five' if you didn't want to use the name - 五月 is how you'd write it in chinese characters.If you want to blame someone for the system in use, I'd suggest starting with the Jesuits, who as the scientific wing of the catholic church spread clockwork and steel cannons across much of asia. They also brought their date systems with them, which is why a 24 hour clock and seven day week is pretty much universally accepted.The difference between day and month in terms of indexing can be reduced to that of the difference between both nominal and cardinal values and ordinal values.The system we use uses nominal values for months, and ordinal values for days and years. It should probably use ordinal values for the lot. Note, though that Korean (and I expect Japanese and Chinese) uses cardinal values, rather than ordinal values for month. O-Ueol (五月) vs' O-Beon-JJae-Ueol (五番째月), except that normally the chinese characters aren't used in the second case.This was probably far more than you wanted to know, but the point is that given that there are trivial mappings between these forms, the particular representation format chosen isn't that big a deal.If you want to see _real_ problems with computational notions of time, I'd refer you to 'A Long, Painful History of Time' (http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~enag/lugm-time.html). 203.231.161.129\n",

In this case [τ=t] is a function of X1 through Xt, which is what I was aiming for in the definition given here.I'm not sure how to make the \"independent of the future\" style definition work-for example, we could have a martingale where Xt+1 encodes in some subtle way (e.g. by minute perturbations of the lower-order bits) all of the preceding values.

Many in the Third World, including many Third World leaders, regard him as a hero and respect even more for his defiance of the British.Saying that the “international community” rejects him thus displays a Western bias.You have written a blatantly propagandistic introduction to the Robert Mugabe article. You say that you're ‘calling a spade a spade.’ Frankly, this is an admission to violating NPOV guidelines.Quoting only sources hostile to Mugabe’s land reforms is inappropriate in an introduction. Saying that he’s been rejected by the “international community” is also inappropriate. Since when did the Western ex-colonial powers account for the entirety of the international community? You allege that he’s a racist persecuting whites. Others feel that he’s implementing essential land reforms and carrying out a delayed de-colonization of a country ravanged by apartheid and racism. The introduction shouldn’t endorse any particular point of view.The introduction reads like a middle-schooler's essay explaining why he hates Mugabe.Instead, this article needs a more encyclopedic introduction along with a balance of opposing viewpoints if it quotes opinions regarding Mugabe’s presidency.I know that, Danny. I have a PhD in history and decolonization is one of my areas of expertise. It was still a British colony before the declaration of “Rhodesia’s” independence and that racist government was just an outgrowth of British colonialism.Saying that he’s been banned from the Commonwealth is enough.Refrain from hyperbole too. Mugabe’s not Hitler and land reform’s not the Holocaust.Amnesty International is also a Western organization with little understanding of the historical realities of the Third World.And you cannot disconnect his “autocratic” policies from the land reforms. The latter necessitates the former.To understand that, you need a grounding in the historical realities of this country.Before 1980 Zimbabwe was a white-supremacist British colony that went by the name of Rhodesia, after the British financier Cecil Rhodes, whose company, the British South Africa Company, stole the land from the indigenous Matabele and Mashona people in the 1890s. British soldiers, who laid claim to the land by force of arms on behalf of Rhodes, were each rewarded with nine square miles of land. The Matabele and Mashona  those who weren't killed defending their land were rewarded with dispossession, grinding poverty, misery and subjugation. Today, in a country of 13 million, almost 70 percent of the country's arable agricultural land is owned by an elite of some 4,500 mostly white farmers, many descendant from the British soldiers who Rhodes blessed with a claim to stolen land, to pass down the generations.After a long campaign for national liberation, independence talks were held in 1979. Talks almost broke down over the land question, but Washington and London, eager for a settlement, agreed to ante up and arrange for financial support for a comprehensive land reform program. If you were going to return land to the peasants who had been working it  the rightful owners  you'd have to compensate the white landholders. But the assistance, and therefore, a workable land resettlement plan, was never forthcoming.That was a problem, because the land issue was largely what drove the struggle for national liberation, and has remained at the heart of Zimbabwean politics since. Unresolved, it festered.Frustrated, and under pressure from war veterans who had grown tired of waiting for the land reform they'd fought for, Mugabe embarked on a course that would lead him headlong into collision with the IMF and Western governments. He passed legislation enabling the government to seize nearly 1,500 farms owned by white Zimbabweans, without compensation. As Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Minister, Dr. I.S.G Mudenge put it, at that point \"all hell broke loose.\" Having held free and fair elections on time, and having won them, Mugabe now became international goat and pariah, on the wrong side of London, Washington and international lending institutions. A dictator, a stealer of elections, a thug. That was to be his new guise.The first thing the EU did was commission a study. The study concluded that Mugabe would have to go, forced out by civil society, the union movement or NGO's, uprisings in the street, maybe even a military coup. \"By hook or by crook, but mostly by crook,\" Mugabe would be ousted.On 24 January, 1999, a meeting was convened at the Royal Institute of International Affairs to discuss the report. The theme of the meeting, led by The Economist's Richard Dowden, was \"Zimbabwe - Time for Mugabe to Go?\" Mugabe's \"confiscating\" of white-held land compelled an unequivocal answer to the conference's rhetorical question: Yes. Dowden presented four options:1) a military coup;2) buying the opposition;3) insurrection; and4) subverting Mugabe's ZANU-PF party.On March 23 of that year, Washington weighed in. The US State Department held a seminar to discuss a strategy for dealing with the \"Zimbabwe crisis.\" Civil society and the opposition would be strengthened to foment discontent and dissent. The opposition would be brought together under a single banner to enhance its chances of success at the polls and funding would be funnelled to the opposition through Western backed NGO's. Dissident groups could be strengthened and encouraged to take to the streets. The same plan was to work later in Belgrade (naïvely celebrated today by a large part of the US left as a model of grassroots, non-violent, change from below.) It could work in Harare.Opposition leaders were told to put their differences aside and unite under a single banner. Washington would bankroll their campaigns, and fund NGOs and civil society to put pressure on the government. In Zimbabwe, the electoral opposition coalesced under the banner, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).Of course, none of these opposition groups had any special claim to being democratic, but the appropriation of the democratic cache was intended to make it seem that the government was authoritarian and antidemocratic.Under these circumstances the reviled leader is caught in an unfair position. Allow the massive interference of Western governments to go unchecked, and forfeit the only chance of a free and fair election. Take steps to limit the interference and give your opponents ammunition to step up the charges that you're authoritarian and antidemocractic.-I'd just like to thank you so much for reverting People on stamps for me. -Danny:First, I believe those parliamentary figures are outdated. I’ll check.Second, I stand behind what I said.If there are competitive, multiparty elections to be rigged in the first place what you have in Zimbabwe is closer to the British model than the Stalinist model. Regardless, food, vaccination, preventative medicine (don’t forget the AIDS crisis) shelter, and clean water are more important than a free press in a country as impoverished and underdeveloped as Zimbabwe. White Americans, in contrast, seem to care more about their rights to fund veiled pro-racist NGOs in Zimbabwe than about the material well-being of a over ten million improvised Zimbabweans.I’ll be honest. Mugabe shouldn’t have abandoned the single-party state in the first place. That’s what left Zimbabwe open to outside interference, which has really been destabilizing the country. I want Mugabe to subvert the self-serving, neocolonial opposition as much as he can in order to offset their funding advantage provided by greedy, greedy colonialists. He can’t surrender Zimbabwe’s long struggle for national liberation begun when British troops (the ancestors of those 4,000 or so pseudo-aristocrats) massacred nearly everyone in Matabeleland’s military in Bulawayo their 1890 \"preemptive\" attack. Just because the white farmers figured out how to legitimize the illegitimate under the guise of “free elections,” with that treasonous MDC puppet potentate, Mugabe does not surrender his heroic cause.It’s a about time we’re seeing unemployed youths, aspiring bureaucrats, and war veterans taking back what was stolen from their people in the first place. They’re not all Mugabe cronies. Some are, though; and they’re even preferable to what you had before. Regarding the white farmers and their ex-colonial overlords who fund the opposition, no fair-minded person should have an iota of sympathy for those racist parasites.And you can’t develop Zimbabwe’s economy without taking these difficult measures. You can’t have vibrant capitalist development in such a latifundia economy in which 4,000 racist pseudo-aristocrats own 70% of the arable land in an agrarian country of 13 million. Given the resistance, the expropriation process had to be haphazard. This will cause hardships in the short run, but once things have stabilized productivity will have recovered if Mugabe is able to fend of the enemies of the Zimbabwean people.I wish sell-out Mandela and Mbeki and their ANC had the courage and resolve of Mugabe and his ZANU-PF.No prob with the Alma Mahler relocation (though I sort of like maiden names), and a big \"wow!\" at all the info you've added.  I'll have to do a bit of research on dates and details, but I do hope to be able to add to it!   04:38 Mar 31, 2003 (UTC)I have finished working on Hafiz for the meantime, I will make further necessary adjustments. Danny, I have made some changes to the Halakha article, trying to briefly describe the halakhic process.  (I know, there is no one set methodology that all rabbis agree on!  I am using the term in a general sense.)  When you get a chance please take a look, and if you see anything that needs fixin', please do so, or let me know what changes or additions you think I should add. You were the one with the POV problem. I favored removing sentences like ‘he’s a totalitarian leader bent on staying in power rejected by the international community’ with ‘because of his controversial policies Zimbabwe as suspended from the Commonwealth’. You clearly don’t know the difference between the commentary of a propagandist and the neutral, matter of fact content that really belongs in an encyclopedia. You are a liar and a hypocrite for saying that I was refusing to accept any point that contradicted my viewpoint, whatever that viewpoint is. You were the one protecting the page, a dead violation of protocol, so that I could not add facts that contradicted your anti-Mugabe obsessions.Although this has nothing to do with the above criticism, I think that your failure to understand Zimbabwe's historical and material realities also makes you a white supremacist.You are really pushing it now, 172, if you dont start behavibng you will be banned. -fonzyLiar and hypocrite, huh? You forgot to mention that I'm overweight and I smoke too much. Anti-Mugabe obsession? Get real. I've actually worked on some other articles too. As for being a white supremacist, I suggest you look on my page at some of my contributions. Now, with regard to your PhD in history, you have used ad hominem attacks and plagiarized texts to get your point across. Your dissertation must have been a gem. uh, I thought you were going to quit smoking ... I know that I’m not making many friends, but I’m the only one dedicated to making the Mugabe article an informative, illuminating, and balanced article. I care more about doing what’s right than what's popular.Should more of those cleopatra pages (that say she lived to be 100 yrs old) be blanked like you started to do? Yes. It is ''so odd'' that the biggest page of on a victim of the Palestinian issue is a white, blonde, blue eyed attractive American woman! *heavy irony!!!* The irony is of course that so many Americans on wiki don't realise the bizarre fact. She seems like becoming white middle class pro-Palestinian America's virgin mary, to whom we need a shrine. (Maybe I better change that. I've just spent days working on the Blessed Virgin Mary page. Opps! Though hopefully that is an encyclopædic entry and not a shrine!!!)My God, someone else with the ''culpa focail''! Reminds me of some friends who visited Capitol Hill recently on St. Patrick's day and were asked to speak ''as gaeilge''. So they said the ''Ár n-athair'' to each other as a dialogue. And a couple of US congressmen were all watery-eyed at hearing the 'old mother tongue'. *grin* Though they were puzzled that one of the guys speaking the Our Father ''as gaeilge'' was black. A black Irishman with perfect Irish? They couldn't get over it. -)  23:38 Apr 8, 2003 (UTC)It gets even funnier. You probably know more Irish and love it more than most Irish people. Unfortunately the manner in which it was taught in school made it hated by generations. A teaching approach of 'by God, we'll make you speak this language if it the last thing we do' produced a response of 'by God we'll never speak that fucking language if it is the last thing we do'. My classmates ceremonially burned their Irish books and took oaths never to use the language from the moment they left school. Most people if they ever ''return'' to the language (and most don't after the gestapo-teaching methods of the Irish language lobby) ''do'' fall in love with it, but it is ''inspite of'', not because of, the Irish language lobby. Some years ago a politician called 'Mrs. Lemass' ''lost'' a by-election because of a letter sent around cutting people's social welfare. They blamed her personally because the letter had the words ''Ís Mise le Meas'' (ie, yours sincerely) which people, knowing so little Irish took to read ''Mrs. Lemass''!!!According to recent figures, the Irish language is in such decline in ''Gaeltachtai'' (Irish speaking areas) that 80% of those receiving tax-break because they supposedly speak the language, don't. Whereas previous worst case senarios predicted the demise of gaeltacht Irish in as little as fifty years, the shocking outcome of that recent survey suggests it could be largely dead in as little as ten years. And the major blame, ironically, lies with Irish language fanatics who so tried to bully people into speaking it that they turned most generations since 1922 into hating it in a way that it never hated under British rule. Already the new national gaelic-speaking TV station only survives by showing english soccer with english-language commentaries, with a few Irish language programmes all subtitled in english. I only wish I had better Irish, but I so came to hate it in school (like everyone else I knew), where you had to read eighteenth century love poetry, Peig Sayers ''ad nausaum'', more sixteenth century poetry about cattle, more Peig Sayers, then another dollop of Peig Sayers in which her 940th son fell to his death, and she said 'woe is me' ''as gaeilge'' for the 1,354,021st time, that you switched off and just wished the language would hurry up and die before the exams came around. It is only afterwards, reading Peig ''as bearla'' (in english) and suddenly understanding the beauty lost in the painstaking translation classes, that inspite of the teaching, I am now falling in love with the language. In that I am in a small minority, indeed a smaller one than I could possibly have imagined before the report on language use in the gaeltachtaí.OK. That's my sermon on Irish over with, before I clog up your talk page entirely. Hopefully, though the odds seem against it, it may survive as a spoken language in the gaeltachtaí. It is booming among a small minority in galltachtaí (english-speaking areas) but somehow losing it as a spoken language in areas like gaeltachtaí where it has been spoken for millenia would mark its effective end, because with its death there you will lose its history, folklore, tradition, dialects, etc none of which can be restored with the odd Irish language school in an english-speaking urban centre. And on that depressing, downbeat note, it is time to write another article!!! ''Slán''  00:58 Apr 9, 2003 (UTC)If you get the chance to read Spenser on Ireland, among other things you will see how 16th century Irish culture had a huge tendency to make English incomers go native (which he deplored). PML.Yeah. It was called ''becoming more Irish than the Irish themselves.''\"Ipsis Hibernis Hiberniores\". PML.Thus people began to talk about ''mere Irish'' (mere in its old sense, ie, ''pure'') to distinguish non-Irish 'irishmen'!  01:31 Apr 9, 2003 (UTC)You people believe Lir/Vera/Dietary Fiber/Susan/Adam?All I did was clarify this sentence pointed out by Dachshund: “As mentioned, the Soviets bore the heaviest casualties of World War II.  These war causalities can explain much of Russia's behavior after the war.”I added content. I did not delete content. Maybe some user prior do me deleted some content, but who knows. I wasn’t following the rest of the article, just this sentence pointed out by Dachshund.My parents were Holocaust survivors and my entire family apart from the two of them was eradicated. I demand an apology for all you users who believe that slander coming from that lunatic user who has been banned repeatedly. I don’t think that I’ve ever lashed out against anyone violently in my entire life, but if those charges were made against me in person I doubt that I would have been able to control myself.If the charges by this latest reincarnation of Lir have made it onto the mailing list, then I expect you people to correct these charges so that nobody is under the impression that I did this.Sorry, Danny.  I actually thought about moving it to the Jokes page.   I realize that the content of the article heavily focuses on Zionism; this is an important topic nonetheless since Zionism was the second major Jewish movement crushed by Soviet authorities following the breakup of the Jewish Labor Bund under the tutelage of Lenin. And remember that restrictive Soviet emigration policies, particularly with regards to its Jewish population, drew significant amounts of Western criticism during the Cold War. Remember the Jackson-Pollack legislation?  It’s also significant in light of the huge proportion of the Jewish population within the former Soviet Union that has emigrated to Israel in recent years. I do realize that this article is heavily weighted toward the pre-war years, but it is a work in progress.I do apologize, however, for omitting the Anti-Fascist League by mistake. I’m stunned that I left it out somehow. I believe that I did write a paragraph or two on that topic. Perhaps it got lost with all the cutting, pasting, and editing. Oh well, that’s my mistake. I’d appreciate it if you added it. Otherwise, I’ll get around to it.Your above comments, however, misrepresent the article's contents. The Doctor's Plot is mentioned, but it doesn’t require ''vast'' amounts of attention since it is still a matter of idle historical speculation of a crisis averted. Feel free to add content about the Doctor’s Plot, but keep that in mind. I’m familiar with Veidlinger's work as well, but also keep in mind that this is a general historical narrative and the article already deals with Jewish institutions, even ones of an artistic nature.Regarding recent comments in the talk page:Of course I know that. Sorry for the poor wording, but please don't suggest things like that just because my wording might have been ambiguous. Clarify the wording, but don't suggest that I failed to realize something as elementary as the boundary shifts.The article is light on concrete specifics, as it is a work in progress, but the framework for addressing what you cited as the gradual persecution of Jews under Stalin is already there. And really that what's needed for the beginning.For instance, at one point I believe that the article briefly states that Soviet Jews were “were the immediate benefactors of, but long-term victims of the Marxist notion that any manifestation of nationalism is \"socially retrogressive\", a notion threatening to Jewish cultural institutions, the Jewish Labor Bund, Jewish autonomy, and Zionism.” The article thus goes into considerable detail explaining the problems of Marxist internationalism and the national question of the Jewish people. It does make it clear that the Jewish identity is supposed to fade away according to Marx's ideal. It introduces why and when Stalin often contradicted that ideal and when he switched sides on that debate depending on other conditions; and, of course, the recognition of Israel comes to mind along with the founding to the Jewish Autonomous Soviet Socialist Oblast in Birobidzhan. It also goes over how the Soviets were able to get around their ideology (which really doesn't have a framework for dealing with Jews in a socialist society on a theoretical level) by labeling them as an ethnic group, which is deserving of autonomy according to Leninist \"self-determination\" so long as it has a territorial base. It mentions that upon the disillusion of the USSR that Jews were considered the 11th largest nationality. And this goes to the fundamental question of what is a Jew.Thus, the article is a framework for future contributions since it addresses the state's ideals and how it dealt with its Jewish population according to these ideals and how it often contradicted these ideals (often to the benefit of the Jewish identity) pragmatically due to other factors.I’m not sure where the leading scholars of the period and the topic might disagree with certain key aspects of the position in the article either (if it is taking any controversial position for that matter). I haven’t really taken a position on the Doctor’s Plot; I just didn’t go into great detail on it, contented to develop a general narrative that can be expounded by specifics that any contributor can feel free to add.I think that the brief section on Kaganovich is throwing you off, probably leading you to think that the article was suggestion that everything was great once the Bolsheviks liberated the Jews from the backward-thinking unenlightened Czarist tyrants. It was there not to suggest that the interest of Soviet Jews always coincided with the Soviet state, but just to suggest that there is a difference between the primitive anti-Semitism of the Czarist past and the caviler anti-Semitism of Marxist internationalism which suggests that the Jewish identity will fade a way once the revolution puts an end to the class struggle and rids society of primitive superstitions. So, it gets into the irony that I think you were describing earlier of an ideology that condemns prejudice against individuals of Jewish backgrounds but still manages to suggest that all would be better if the Jewish identity \"withered away\" through the abandonment of non-universal institutions and religion.Please be patient with me as well. Despite my Polish Jewish linage, contemporary Jewish history (especially literary, artistic, religious, and cultural developments) is very far from my areas of expertise, which is quite obvious considering the scope of my usual contributions.The article I posted is more of a framework for discussing broad sociological trends and the relationship between the Marxist-Leninist state and its Jewish population. So please, add as much as possible, especially weak areas like the ones that I’ve mentioned.Welcome back! Hope I can correspond in Hebrew with you:רציתי להוסיף מפת פ\"ת כקובץ ששמרתי מתוך MAPQUEST האם לדעת זה ב\"רוח\" / עקרונות ה-WIKI?  13:51 Apr 24, 2003 (UTC)I tried to U-L this file. Pl. take a look at it and tell me what U think  14:34 Apr 24, 2003 (UTC)Is this way-around ok ?You can search for the city map by using MapquestHow does it look? 14:58 Apr 24, 2003 (UTC)We are not arguing that China is a \"communist\" (lower-case \"c\") society in the Marxist sense, that is a state where the means of production are under common ownership. Whether or not China is a \"socialist\" society in Marxian terms, defined by state ownership of the means of production, is further irrelevant to this debate. In this context, the term \"Communist state\" (upper-case \"C\") strictly refers to the type of government in the same sense that \"constitutional monarchy\" describes the governments of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, that \"federal republic\" describes the government-types of the United States and Brazil, that \"Islamic republic\" describes the government-type of Iran, that \"military government\" describes the government of Myanmar, and finally that \"absolute monarchy\" would describe the government of Oman. The government is Communist, ruled by a Marxist-Leninist party.Divergences between the development levels, levels of state ownership, and economic structures between the five Communist states of China, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba, and North Korea or whether or not China is \"capitalist\" and has betrayed its Marxist-Leninist philosphy thus don't matter to this discussion (I personally think that they haven't and that they've finally found a workable model of socialism worth revisiting, but that doesn't matter either). The ruling Communist parties of these countries share roughly the same structure and share similarly intertwined state and party institutions and share roughly the same constitutional forms. They represent a common government-type based on the Leninist state and are bound by having to adapt to similar circumstances, that is (with the exception of Castro's Cuba which wasn't at first definitively Communist) supplanting or revamping existing state institutions to fit the mold of an underground revolutionary political party.I completely redid the article on neoconservatism, replacing an old rant by an anonymous contributor that fell just short of making references to Zionist conspiracies. Perhaps you’d want to take a look at it. I'm well-aware of all this. I was just trying to suggest that many factions on the left influenced their early thinking. And I wanted to characterize them as generally center-left (with a propensity to lean more and more anti-Soviet), anti-fascist, working class, and eager to see US entry into the Second World War for the sake of brevity.Thanks for looking at the article. If you want you can look at the older version on the neoconservative page. Just click on \"neoconservative\" when you get to the \"neoconservatism\" page and see \"redirected from neoconservative.\" Nothing in it is inaccurate, but it has an anti-Semitic tone due to its preoccupation with Israel, which is absurd since they're really born-again Zionists after the Six Day War. For the sake of brevity once again, I'll say a useful maxim. They like Israel because they're hawks, it's not that they're hawks because they're Jews supporting Israel. I see that you're back on. Want to come back to Neoconservatism (United States)? It's important to finish the links to people like Irving Kristol too. Maybe you could help with that. By the way, here's a link to the old article.http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Neoconservative&oldid;=863386I am trying to get there, but I keep getting this message that I am blocked. Mut be a glitch somewhere.  02:14 Apr 27, 2003 (UTC)Sorry about the blocking.  Michael keeps coming in andvandalizing and I have to keep blocking him.  I do re-unblock in a day or so.   Danny, I have no idea why you're blocked at the article level.  I don't do that  I wouldn't even know how to do that.   Test.  The test worked, by the way. ;) If that was you whose edits in some year entries and such I reverted a couple of days ago, sorry about that. It was the IP looking like Michael's, especially after seeing Zoe's greeting intended for Michael. I think they'll still be in my visible contributions history (I had a near-Wikiless weekend), so I'll see if I can find those and fix them if that turns out to have been you.   10:41 Apr 28, 2003 (UTC)Please look at Supernaturalization and my comment on the talk page, and weigh in,  18:17 May 7, 2003 (UTC)Thanks for editing the Saadia Gaon stuff.  These Britannica articles are coming thick and fast from somewhere, and I seem to be spending a lot of my time just wikifying them, let alone updating them.  However, I admit to being pretty ignorant about Judaism.  17:00 24 May 2003 (UTC)Heh, I bet you thought you were going to have to go back and change the Isfahan disambig. Just like I thought I was going to have to go and move The City of Isfahan to Isfahan (city). ;)   02:12 May 8, 2003 (UTC)Danny, I just started a brief article on Mishpat Ivri. Any suggestions or constructive criticisms would be welcomed. If you could find an image to replace  that would be best.I edited Dome_of_the_Rock and Temple_mount you should like those -)2003 in literature etc. are alphabetized.  We had some difficulty with articles in foreign languages but I think we got most of it right.  Anyway, spot check it when you get a chance and tell us if we owe you a partial refund.  -)  Danny, I did some additions to the stub on Meforshim. Ezra Wax will blow a gasket when he sees post 17th century commentators mentioned....  02:58 22 May 2003 (UTC)Thanks, Danny  but if this nastiness from Jacques keeps on, I don't know how long I will stay.  I do have better things to do with my time than defend myself ;-) Knowing wikipedians like you are still around and supportive sure helps, though! Why did you delete this statement of fact from Merovingian? \"They are considered by virtually all qualified historians as the first French royal house. (See references below.)\"  That seems strange when to support wildly non NPOV statements by Ms. K in French Monarchs, like \"Highly debatable\" and her \"allowing\" the Carolingians. My insertion is not only proper, but documented by facts rather than personal biases.Yes, we're not very strong on fine art, I agree. I keep writing articles on contemporary British artists, but they're not always very well known figures, and we're lacking articles on some very significant international artists (in particular, I keep meaning to write about Barnett Newman, whose stuff I love). Anyway, things will continue to slowly improve, I'm sure. Good job on starting FrankenthalerHello Danny, I just read your edit comment \"new article based on the Nuttall encyc. being processed at DP\": can you tell me what the Nuttall encyclopedia and DP are?   11:40 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)Thanks for the reply, Danny: that sounds like a useful resource. I can't find a pointer to it anywhere on Google, could you please add it to Wikipedia:Public domain resources as soon as it is available publically? Danny, I have made some changes (hopefully improvements) to the Judeo-Islamic tradition page.  13:48 22 Jun 2003 (UTC) 23:04 26 May 2003, Danny blocked 67.125.136.31 (contribs) (unblock) (consistent vandalism) time to unblock? No.  conciseness. I like that. ) Is it a static or a dynamic IP?  00:03 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)The person was a vandal, attacking articles. When someone using the IP number requests that it be unblocked, then it is open for consideration, and I will be willing to unban. Until then, that person has long disappeared so there is no reason to waste time on this. I highly recommend that instead of worrying about a bunch of vandals who got banned, we all get on with the job of writing an encyclopedia. And when did you last contribute a new article ...  00:15 30 Jun 2003 (UTC) 15:45 29 Jun 2003 Passport To Pimlico (stub from Talk:Burgundians) I'll unblock the IP address then.  09:24 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)Hi, I am a new comer here, and I found u at Queer wikipedians.

That article is in fairly bad shape, but I've only really begun working on the 1918-present articles, which are in far better shape, yet still unfinished. Not to burden you, but the series could use another contributor. If you're unable, that's fine. After all, I've been declining many offers due to the burden of this series. I'd been meaning to thank you for the article on the Edelweiss Pirates, very interesting subject.  That was a lot to write on such short notice.  ) -  21:26 25 Jul 2003 (UTC)הי דניאני כותב אליך בעברית, כי אני מניח שאתה דובר וקורא עברית.אני רק רוצה לוודא כי אתה יודע שפרויקט הויקיפדיה בעברית יצא לדרך לפני כ-3 שבועותאני יודע גם כי אין לך בעיה להגיע / לנווט לשם.מה דעתך להצטרף גם לויקי. בעברית ולתרום איכשהו מניסיונך הרב בעבודה בויקי. אין לי ספק שתוכל לתרום '''המון''' ואני מעריך כי להיות בין המייסדים של פרויקט כזה, היא זכות לא קטנה (כך לפחות אני חושב ביחס לעצמי)שני המשתמשים / העורכים של האנציקלופדיה הם: רותם דן ו-AAARRGGGHHHבשם השני בטוח שלא דייקתייש כבר מאמרים (לדעתי חלקם מועתקים) ויש פעילות התחלתית די יפה ומרשימהאגב, בויקי בעברית, הכיוי שלי הוא דוד1 (ממש מפתיע נכון?)אז להתראות ב\"עברית\" - ולפחות תן תגובהSorry I did not put some  in the Hebrew part, but now it's going to be too diff.

I've been warned continually by Mav to summarize on the series pages and to go in depth in the hyperlink articles. So, with that in mind, I suggest that you go into the socio-economics of the opposition to the Vietnam War in Vietnam War, an article that haven't edited yet. If what you've suggested isn't in that article, it's actually really pressing that you add it or I add it. I agree completely that real analysis of antiwar sentiment has been thwarted by the knee-jerk tendency, even among good scholars, to focus on the more memorable, more well-publicized hippy and counterculture antiwar movement among college students.  03:45 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)Hi, you cast a vote in the TEMP5 debate. The Temp5 proposal was voted down by 61.3% to 38.6%. We seem to be going around in circles on the whole issue of the main page. A new vote is now taking place to clarify what ''exactly'' we want, namely Do we actually ''want'' to have a new page? If so ''when'' (immediately, after a pause, timed to the press release, etc)? What do people want on the front page and what do they want excluded?As of now, the whole issue seems surrounded by complete confusion. This way, ''finally'' and ''definitively'', we will know ''what'' we want and ''when'' we want it. So do please express your opinions. The vote is on the same page as the previous votes. Curious  on the sloganZ=R page, what exactly were you \"tired\" of?  RK? The subject? It was hard to tell from your comment. Respectfully, -When RK comes back I want to nominate him for sysop (again) I dont ask for much, but I ask that you support his nomination. Sincerely-תודה-Hi! You seem to know alot about Jerusalems walls. Care to elaborate a little on the topic? This page  clearly lists two sets of walls and I can't figure out which set is considered the \"real\" \"old wall\" or if both of them is the \"old wall\". It also lists the Ginnoth Gate, Women's Gate and the Tadi Gate which is not mentioned in other sources. To my understanding the walls were razed and rebuilt many times. The Jaffa Gate for example is listed on the model of Jerusalem 60 CE, but another source says it was built in the 16th century. Hi. You have made edits to the Isla Perejil page. Since I have questions about the accuracy of information added by user 193.136.200.43, can you take a look at Isla Perejil and at Talk:Isla Perejil and check this?  23:53, 23 Sep 2003 (UTC)Hi, regarding your vote on http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_logo_vote/Ratification#English_WikipediaTo be valid you need to have a active userpage on Meta which points to your userpage of your home-wikipedia  23:00, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)To be clear about this; In the other vote rounds some votes where not counted because there was no active userpage and no link to the home-wiki.

If one refered to \"humankind related-to themes\", what does it mean \"old\"? As \"old\" as \"historical\" mankind is or as \"old\" as us, the living contemporary mankind, can remind about ourselves of? Because in both cases, it does not mean \"unimportant\", \"unfashioned\" or \"must be forgotten\", as I have a vague impression was intented! On the contrary!Also, unforgivenly, the complete real title \"Divanul sau Galceava Inteleptului cu Lumea sau Giudetul Sufletului cu Trupul\" is mistaken/shortened with \"Divanul Lumii\"/\"the World's Divan\"/\"le divan du monde\", which really doesn't say or mean anything. Divanul/the Divan/le divan by itself is even more suggestive than the meaning of the two associated words.The whole title can be translated in french and english, respectively, as: \"Le divan ou la dispute du sage avec le monde ou le jugement de l'ame avec le corps\", \"The Divan or The Wise Man's Parley with the World or The Judgement of the Soul with the Body\".The publishing place and date are: Iasi 1698.\n",

PNGs are not very sensible I think.  (However I haven't tried it so far.)Should we try to show the reader the connection of the asterisms and the constellation drawings?

If this is done the person making the move can mention that user:Ktsquare first created this page (under ip 24.100.81.xxx) someplace elseand has done much of the work on it. You could also put a link to the history of Tables of Chinese Sovereigns in the talk of the new page. No, there really is no official watchlist for naughty users other than RecentChanges (hit \"show last 5000 changes\" and then search for the person's IP). What I do is just copydown the visible part of the IP and place that on my user page. Of course, if this person is doing a systemic attackthen please add this person's visible IP to VANDALISM IN PROGRESS to elicit the help of others to undo the harm the vandal is doing(if an administrator is around then the vandal will be warned and then blocked if the warning is ignored).As a matter of policy though, defacing a single page is not usually considered to be vandalism  it is oftentimes just tagging bya person who doesn't have a clue what the project is about and is just experimenting. Most of these people leave after a single\"incident\" and never come back  as your exampleseems to have done. When you see a newly created page like History of Indochina that has nothing but garbage on it, simplydelete the garbage and either vote to delete the page or create a short stub to replace the garbage. Of course, always check the history tomake sure an article isn't hiding behind in the page's history. Hi! Please see recent Talk:Wu HuWell, it wasn't much help really; you're obviously much more knowledgeable about it.  -)  Cheers, Do you know whether the term ''Rape of Nanking'' was in use '''before''' the book of that name was published? I sort of recall that it was, but I'm not an expert in history. '''Before''' that book was published, the term only means rapes of women during the 2 months of atrocities inside the city but the book used the term for referring to the Nanjing Massacre. Such a use is acceptable. In other words, the term means only part of atrocities before the publish and the book generalized to the whole massacre.  KtsquareNot true. Rape has always had the meaning of destruction and murder over a large area. For instance, the Glencoe Massacre is refered to as the rape of Glencoe. I'm fairly certain Rape of Nanking was in use for quite a while too. rmhermenI agree that the term Rape of Nanking was in use quite a while but my previous point was on what the term is referring to, not on how long it has lasted. Research on Google and my knowledge gave me contradictory results. I have always believed that the term was a western term for Nanjing Massacre. Some webpages used it only for rape of women during those 2 1/2 months, some refer to the whole incident anmd some don't even bother to use it at all. Since Nanjing Massacre can only refer to the incident, I prefer using that instaed of the Rape of Nanking. Some research papers in US are now using Nanjing Massacre and some invented a new term '''Nanjing Atrocities''', adding more confusion to the confusing enough nomenclature.an example.search \"rape\" and \"massacre\". They refer to the same incident.II. The Death Toll ? Current Estimates:1st paragraph:....The notion here is that if the figure of 300,000 (or any higher end of the estimates for that matter) does not stand, it is no longer the Nanking Atrocities (or the '''Nanjing Massacre''' or '''the Rape of Nanking''')....Ktsquare  please be aware that the Hull genealogy website is CRAP.  It is not accurate and we have had many problems with people using it (and most other genealogical websites) as reference material.  No professional European historian I know (and I know lots of them  and am one myself) would trust it.  As a history student, you should really avail yourself of the opportunity to use sources critically.  Remember, genealogy isn't history, and most amateur genealogists (certainly not all, but most) usually don't have the language skills or background to be as trustworthy as many other sources available. Thanx very much for your helpful advice.Your concern probably arised from your comment on talk:Charles. I personally don't trust the Hull website and those material on Charles are direct reposts of existing wikipedia articles. The link was just an old shortcut which was probably created during my high school years. IMO accuracy of genealogical records depends on 1) how accurate is the source, 2)expertise of the amatuer, 3) how detailed are those records. Just out of curiosity, is \"Europaische Stammtafeln\" a trustworthy source? I heard of the title before and trust me, I'm not going to copy those materials onto wikipedia. BTW I have already stopped collecting genealogical data since I entered university. Thanx again. Ktsquare Which edition?  There are several excellent prosopographical works out there in German  depends on the subject and time period as to how good they are.   I honestly would not rely on anything absolutely, unless it clearly demonstrates how it came to the conclusions it does, and what primary sources are used.  IMO The latest edition would be the best by common sense. BTW do you use prosographical material frequently during your years of research? KtsquareI wouldn't agree that latest is always best  the original wasn't written with genealogists in mind  I don't know about the Neue Folge.  I think it is probably helpful in tracing family trees, but dangerous in the hands of people who don't know what they're looking at.  For example, many German genealogical and prosopographical sources will use a \"von somewhere\" after a name.  The historian understands that this is usually not part of a title nor indicates heritable lands  at least before the late 10th c., because there weren't all that many inheritable titles, outside of royalty, before then.  So where I see that (for example only) Welf, a graf in Alemannia, married Gerswintha v. Sachsen in 810, I see that Welf held the title of ''comes''  which may or may not have been connected to a permanent office, possibly ''not'' in Alemannia (that might be where his family was from), who married a woman who was ''either'' from Saxony (not the same as today's Saxony) or was of Saxon descent.  HJ, on the other hand, would see this as Welf, Count of Alemannia, married a noblewoman named Gerswintha von Sachsen.  Believe me, the differences could be vast.And yes, if you hadn't figured it out by now, I do use a lot of prosopographical stuff in my research.  And I do dislike most amateur genealogy, because the aim in most cases seems not to learn for the sake of finding out more about history and the people who contributed to it, but seems more to be a purely egotistical attempt to claim noble blood and sometimes to prove longtime claims to lands that have changed hands many times over the years.  Personally, I would rather do something interesting and important myself than say that by no fault of my own, I'm related to some long dead king.  But maybe my priorities are mixed up ;-) Good to know Euroepean history researchers use a lot of prosopographical material. However it seems like not a single book you could totally rely on when conducting researches, from understanding of your words. Shouldn't there be some stuff (prosopographical or not) that are universally accepted as accurate sources regardless of how detail it is? Say what material you would trust when writing your dissertion on Carolingians?Fabricating connection to noble blood could serve as a logical groud for legally claiming land or property. Even Bruce Lee (for example only) could claim himself of royal blood if one intends to make up connections. LOL. I just ignore them.KtsquareHi  I'll answer the above when I have a sec.  In the meantime, I would say that, for the House of Savoy, i'd certainly not translate Arcim- or Arcibaldo into English.  Not that the translation is wrong, but that it sounds funny.  I can't even say why, except that it's probably just a usage/comfort thing, and that Archibald sounds Scottish. Thanks for the images of, for example, Ellsworth Bunker; but please go read Wikipedia:Image use policy and help us keep the quality of images here high.   In particular, it's a bad idea to mix photographic images and text; photos should be in JPEG format, drawings in PNG format.  GIF is deprecated.  Further, please describe where these images came from on the description page so we can be sure we have the right to use them.  Okay.Most of the sources you list offer public domain images, so there's probably no copyright problem, but we should at least mention the web site where you got the images.In case you hadn't noticed it before, you might want to take a look at Wikipedia:How to rename a page; using the \"move page\" link in the sidebar you can more easily move a page to a new title, keeping the edit history and talk page with it intact.  02:21 Oct 8, 2002 (UTC)Reading your comment at Talk%3AChristopher_Columbus, I thought briefly that JHK had come back, and got all excited.  Shame on you.  ;-)  Excuse me, '''Shame on me'''? I don't get your joke.Eh, sorry.  I've been up too long and had a few.  Don't mind me.  I meant no offense.  That's okay. BTW now I understand what you mean.Good ides about the WikiProject Battles!  I was thinking of that when I adapted the box from WikiProject Elements.  Nevertheless the new user  deserves a great deal of credit.  If you look at his earlier version of Battle of L¡§©ötzen (1632) he had put the basics of this battle in point form at the beginning.  All I did was adapt an existing Wikipedia concept of boxes.When I set up the box I resisted the temptation of copying it elsewhere since this was indeed a primitive first attempt.  I even resisted splitting off the 2nd battle of the same name.  Do you have any suggestions about the box structure itself? Additional material that should appear there?  Colour coding for the box heading (geographical or time period)?  19:02 Oct 20, 2002 (UTC)Regarding Magnus I genealogy: I do have it, and will also develop this on the Swedish pages aswell on the english. Is there any standard of how tp present genealogy on the english wikipedia? Followed your advice and made a suggestion at Wikipedia:WikiProject_Genealogy, now how can I find the proper people to discuss this topic with? Or do I mention the suggestion at the village pump/ meta pages?  14:36 Dec 9, 2002 (UTC)HI, and thanks for your message. I understood from the discussions reg this topic that there was \"from above\" a reluctant interest to settle genalogical standards on the Wikipedia, which might minimize errors. The interest to correct false genealogy or errors as well. It seems for me to great an effort to convince someone who doesnt want, or need structures that may avoid errors, and I am somehow tired of time vasting \"fight againt windmills\". So I happily develop this system on the Swedish wikipedia (for Gustav I of Sweden at http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskussion:Gustav_Vasa as ''one'' example) until I get signals from any sort of '''active constructive interest''' to develop this on the english wikipedia. But \"Politics\" on the English wikipedia is not my problem, I was just trying to help. Now, developing a system on the swedish wikipedia, I can check the genealogy up, and eventually correct the one on the english one.Your words is nevertheless nice to get, and I thank you.  09:10 Dec 16, 2002 (UTC), a ) visitor in Yosemite in 1964.Check out my comment on Talk:List of compounds  Hopefully, you'll find some more light on mineral classification by composition here Talk:Mineral. There is a message for you at Talk:Stephen V of Hungary Hi, is Qin Zhao Xiang Wang (秦昭襄王) romanized as \"Qin Zhao '''Sh'''ang Wang\" on page \"Qin Dynasty\" because it's the version most popularly known to the West or it's a typo?  08:22 Feb 13, 2003 (UTC)You said \"I used 'Xiang' because it's the pinyin romaization for '襄'\". But that wasn't why I asked you. I understood why you used Xiang, but not '''Shang'''. Are you saying that Shang (殤) is another posthumous name for Ying Ze? But exact (quoted) searches for 秦昭殤王, Qing Zhao Shang Wang, 秦殤王, and Qing Shang Wang return no results, except the one Wikipage \"Qin Dynasty\" created by you. Of course, the lack of web page does not necessarily mean the nonexistence of the term. But according to my source, in addition to Zhao Xiang Wang, the only other posthumous name for Ying Ze is Xi Di (西帝). Where does this \"Shang\" come from? Thx for explaining.  21:27 Feb 15, 2003 (UTC)'''傳媒 vs. 媒體'''On the page  Wikipedia 对话:命名常规, you used the term \"傳媒\".  I've never heard of it, and I can't find it in my Chinese-English dictionaries. I suspect it means \"media\", but the usual word for \"media\" I hear is 媒體. What's the difference between the two?  07:57 Feb 21, 2003 (UTC)Just wondering where have you heard of 媒體? Do the Chinese-Canadian media use that term also?I used to hear the term 媒體 in Taiwan. It's also the root for the word \"多媒體\" (multi'''media'''). What's the dictionary you use that contains \"傳媒\"?   20:26 Feb 25, 2003 (UTC)\"傳媒\" is used in Cantonese. Just add the terms to [各地華人詞匯對照 at the zhongwen wiki page]'''Zhou Dynasty table division'''Why is the table for Zhou Dynasty (690 AD - 705 AD) subdivided into horizontally two parts: First spanning from the beginning of the Dynasty to Zaichu period, second from Tianshou period to the end of the Dynasty?

It doesn't really make sense to me. (It's from the Chinese 'pedia Main Page.) Is it considered a Chinese proverb? If so, maybe we should add it to the proverb page list, after we find out its metaphorical meaning.  00:39 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)It's discussed on that talk page. One supporter quoted the phrase from an encyclopedia. It looks more like a passable choice than appropiate. Any idea to use another phrase instead?Maybe we can use a saying that has something to do (more explicitly) with the sharing and exchange knowledge? I can't think of one off the top of my head.  20:26 Feb 25, 2003 (UTC)Thanks for pointing out that Rebecca Rodriguez's nickname is ''La Azteca''.

Consult a real lawyer for legal advice.) Suffice to say that not only is the ''recording'' copyrighted, and the ''lyrics'' are copyrighted, but also the ''sequence of notes'' is copyrighted. If you hum a copyrighted song in public, technically you're probably liable for paying royalties. ) Certainly a MIDI representation of the tune of an entire copyrighted song would ''not'' be acceptable for Wikipedia (unless that copyrighted song is also licensed under the GFDL, which is not very likely...) Brief extracts as samples may be acceptable under fair use, however fair use is a tricky thing and I don't personally recommend it.Complete MIDI files (or recordings as OGG or similarly compressed audio) of songs that are in the public domain are A-OK. National anthems... Some countries may copyright them, I don't know. I would imagine most are safe, though particular recordings may be under copyright  this is true also of classic music!  so it's safest to sequence or record them yourself unless you know the recording or file is in the clear.  08:38 Apr 3, 2003 (UTC)Thanx for letting me know but I am just disappointed that I can't upload my favorite songs here. Some are either downloaded from file sharing softwares like KaZaa, especially Leslie Cheung's that I wish to offer as condolences. -)kt2Why are you inserting hr lines into articles? They are ugly and not at all needed when you have a clearly bordered table. Hr lines are used to separate talk threads and different meanings of a single term. They aren't ugly IMO. Anyhow check the new Mustafa II and see if you like it.It looks great! mav'''Manchu/Mongol names'''The sovereign tables of the Yuan Dynasty and Qing Dynasty adopt \"{surname} {given name}\" as Born Names. The Mongols and Manchus did have surnames (or clan names), but I nerver heard Borjigin Temüjin or Aisin Gioro Nurhaci. They are called just Temüjin or Nurhaci. I don't think that they used the Chinese style naming convention.Both Borjigin and Aisin Gioro were adopted AFTER these dynasties moved into China proper. If I recalled correctly, Gioro was a Manchurian clan name and the prefix Aisin was added to specifiy the decendents of Nurhaci. BTW do you know the original clan names of the two royal families? Drawing relationships between the original and adopted clan names might explain why they would adopted the names. - kt2No. They had those clan (obugh) names before they conquered China. Just clan names were not parts of personal names. Borjigin seems a subclan of Kiyan (pl. Kiyad). Chinggis's rival Tayichuud (Tayichighud) clan are his distant relatives.  BTW, do you know why some Western sources call Hong Taiji \"Abahai\"? My Mongolian dictionary says that abakhai (авхай Avhay) means daughter of a nobleman/aristocrat. Pretty odd to me.   03:00 Apr 29, 2003 (UTC)I plead my lack of knowledge here. If my reconcilation is correct, Abahai could mean a son or daughter of a nobleman. Affix(es) specify the sex of a gender-less Manchu word. With that said, that weird dictionary entry becomes obvious as Hong Taiji was obviously a son of a nobleman.  kt2Uhm. I found Abakhai refer to the second son of Dayan Khan. Anyway, I cannot find Hong Taiji be called Abahai in Manchu or Chinese documents. The mystery isn't solved yet.   04:55 May 1, 2003 (UTC)The War at the Great WallIn Song Zheyuan's biography, you mentioned \"The War at the Great Wall\", is that 長城之戰 in Chinese? It'd be useful if we add the Chinese term if we know, since there's no article on that war yet.  20:48 May 13, 2003 (UTC)No problemo. I'll take care of that after I finished editing on Yuan Shikai. ban talk to Hey, what is \"Yoshihito Taisho\"? It's apparently a redirect from Wikipedia:Images with missing articles. Taisho Emperor was never referred to as Yoshihito Taisho. I'll forward this message to Taku for more comments.  kt2I agree with you, so please ask Ms. K to refrain from using derogatory language. It certainly does nothing to advance the discussion. Well I presume every wikipedian (including myself) friendly and politely discusses issues. Petty lapses on any side of the arguments are excusable. ) kt2I am puzzled as to what you are doing to the Patriarchs of Constantinople. Putting them in as [[name ordinal of Constantinople]] is having them follow royal naming conventions but they aren't royalty. Religious leaders in many cases on wiki use their religious title, including popes and cardinals, eg Pope Paul III, etc.  Is there agreement on this move? If there isn't this should be discussed before a wholescale move. It is important that naming conventions are clear, precise and common. Please explain the reason for your changes.  17:34 4 Jun 2003 (UTC)The only relevant \"guideline\" on systematic naming convention is Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles), which has no reference to the patriarchs of constantinople, let alone other patriarchs in Near East and Eastern Europe. Given that, article nomenclature on these articles is a mess. Some use [[name ordinal of a place]], some use [[name of Constantinople]], other use [[name]] only (ex.John Chrysostom) I was trying to modify the list of Constantinople Patriarchs to collect as much links to these articles as possible and at the same time modify the articles as [[name ordinal of Constantinople]]. I will post a discussion thread on Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles).BTW Anyway to draw more attention to Wikipedia talk:Naming_conventions_(chinese). My posts on talk:China and Wikipedia:Village pump only draw 's, 's and your attention to the page. Any standard would be viewed as a agreement of a small group and would not be respected. But if we procastinate, the mess of chinese convention (especially the pinyin vs wade-giles issue) would worsen. Just take a look at History of China, which has become a colony of direct and wrong transliteration of Chinese words, for instance, Yellow Lord instead of the Yellow Emperor. kt2It is correct that the naming conventions on clerical titles is sparce. What little is there was my work. I've found the best route for a change is to outline a suggestion on the naming conventions talk page first. That is not a criticism by the way. I'm glad to hear your suggestions on this area. Naming conventions on royalty was utter mess, far worse than on religious titles. It took a lot of work starting on the talk page for debate to get some semblance of logic and co-ordination.Re the History of China it is a complete mess. I suggested on the talk page that we revert to an earlier version and begin working from that. What is your view? You know a lot more about the topic than I do.  22:03 8 Jun 2003 (UTC)I checked with various people about the above page and the consensus was that in its current form the page is littered with too many mistranslations, inaccuracies and poor grammar to be salvageable. I have reverted to the 31st May version which was generally viewed as the last well written, community contributed to version of this page. I hope that suits you. lol  02:34 9 Jun 2003 (UTC)You've been nominated as a sysop on Wikipedia:Requests for adminship. Please respond there to accept/reject the nomination.  17:10 19 Jun 2003 (UTC)Congratulations, you have just been made a sysop! Sysops basically can't do anything: They cannot delete pages arbitarily (only obvious junk like \"jklasdfl,öasdf JOSH IS GAY\"), they cannot protect pages in an edit war they are involved in, they cannot ban signed in users. What they can do is delete junk as it appears, ban anonymous vandals, remove pages that have been listed on Votes for deletion for more than a week, protect pages when asked to by other members, and help keep the few protected pages there are, among them the precious Main Page, up to date.Note that almost everything you can do can be undone, so don't be ''too'' worried about making mistakes. You will find more information at '''Wikipedia:Administrators''', please take a look before experimenting with your new powers. Drop me a message if there are any questions or if you want to stop being a sysop (could it be?).

Bonne nuitplease look at Racial characteristics.  I just did some basic NPOVing but I believe the article is beyond hope  please look at the original version too.  I think it is just someone's atempt to do an end-run around the race article. Hello, EricdI like the article on Jean-Marie Le Pen. It is much more neutral as the one on the french wikipedia (where I contribute) which is (imho)... I can't find my words in english. In french: plus laudatif qu'objectif. I'll look on a french/english dictionnary and come back. 21:41 19 May 2003 (UTC)More laudative than objective 00:58 23 May 2003 (UTC)Merci... BTW I am French. The article is still very incomplete it lacks for instance the (in)famous \"Durafour crématoire\". I was criticized as being non-neutral, I must say it's not easy to deal with this article I've tried to write some facts with references and avoid as much as possible judgement. But with Le Pen facts will give a rather negative feeling. Strangeless it seems nobody has found positive facts to balance the article. 01:20 23 May 2003 (UTC)HI Eric  DId you read the compromise version I put on the List of French monarchs?  I tried to make it clear that the Merovingians are often considered French Kings and why, but then tried to explain why they weren't.  I appreciate your attempt to make things more neutral and just wanted to bring it out a bit more whay there are these two viewpoints.  Jacques changed that version  it was too wordy, but I think pretty accurate.  JHKHI Eric  important message!Bravo Eric pour ta rapide traduction de la page François Truffaut !

I think Yalta was where Truman was president but I could be wrong. It is years since I studied WWII. In any case, I strongly suspect this image is ''fair use''. It is a historic photo being used in a non-commercial project for educational purposes. Putting on the side of a Corn Flakes box would be a different matter! -) ) Mussolini de Gaulle HirohitoI think taken together they balance the article and personalise it for kids looking for a bit of history. Is that OK with you?  00:20 11 Jul 2003 (UTC)I'm OK but read my comment on Hirohito in  World War II.This is Yalta and Roosevelt. There wasn't any other meeting between Stalin and theAnglo-Americans if you look carefully you will see than Roosevelt looks very tired, he died soon after Yalta... Churchill and many historian considers that the bad health of Rooselvelt and the fact that sltalin insisted for a meeting in USSR disbalanced the negociation in favor of the Russians. 00:26 11 Jul 2003 (UTC)Salut, Eric.Do you have any idea how to get people to agree that the Le Pen article is NPOV? I can't find any way to make it more careful than it is already... Salut de nouveau,I think the problem is not that people sympathise with Le Pen. I think we are all trying to be extra-careful because he's still alive and politically active, and because we are writing about someone we don't like, and that makes us be suspicious of our own motives.  We all write about article about things that interest us because we like or because we dislike... I am extra careful I've read the whole bio of le Pen on the FN site this is mainly bullshit and propaganda with very few content. I still wait for contribution from someone that is sympathetic with le Pen and wants to play the game of NPOV.Do you think Third Reich better or worse now?

            "Hello there Tokerboy, welcome to the 'pedia! I hope you like the place and decide to stay. If you ever need editing help visit Wikipedia:How does one edit a page and experiment at Wikipedia:Sandbox. If you need pointers on how we title pages visit Wikipedia:Naming conventions. If you have any other questions about the project then check out Wikipedia:Help or add a question to the Village pump. BTW, great work on the Roman mythology articles. Cheers! Hi there! I see from my watchlist that you've made a number of link fixes and typo edits. I hope you stick around; attention to detail is a very good trait in a wikipedian!  Hiya Tokerboy, top piece of work on Tuatha de Danaan. You're making a lot of pages with links to redirects to themselves. A page should not link to itself; these should be listed as variants in the article. See Tir na n-Og (it's fine to have variant redirects, but only one should be listed in bold). -You're doing some amazing work on mythological figures.  -)  The only problem is, I want to know more; is there an Aztec equivalent of Edith Hamilton's book on Greek myth? There may be something similar, but non-\"classical\" mythology (Greek, Roman and sometimes Norse) tend to be mostly ignored, though Joseph Campbell did make some references to Aztecs and whatnot. Yes, that's an area typically overlooked.  I have a few books I bought in Mexico; I'll look for them and see if there's anything I can add.  Probably not; your articles seem quite good already.  I've only just started on Aztec mythology.  It's chock full of holes. Tokerboy, I just wanted to say that your continuing addition of mythology entries from so many different countries is really impressive.  Good job.   Tokerboy,Aren't the New Hebrides now the Republic of Vanatu?  If so, the nationality would be Ni-Vanuatu (either singular or plural noun) or Ni-Vanuatu (adjective.). Though perhaps you'd want to say Vanatu, formerly New Hebrides for clarity's sake!  06:46 Sep 25, 2002 (UTC)Do we need lots of one-sentence articles on Aztec mythological characters? I think it would be better to gather several related ones onto one page and make the rest redirects. -Can you slow down a little? I just looked at Hopi mythology and cleared out a large stack of obvious typos, '''and''' removed the instruction to put the text for the new page here. I know you have a lot of info handy, but if it's worth creating a page, it's worth proofreading it.Hey, I just wanted to chirp in that I'm very impressed with the mythology you've been adding.  Also, I might agree with Pierre that the articles could all be one page. Re: mythology.  As somebody who will only be a reader on these pages, when I look at a page like Egyptian mythology, I want to get a good overview of what it's all about, not just a list of names with links.  I'm not going to bother clicking 50 links, especially if I know most of them don't have much content.  I think it will become obvious when there's too much information on one subject and it ought to be split off.  Also, there's no reason we can't duplicate some information on the bigger figures who have their own pages.  I'm thinking about the way we're doing WikiProject Countries with intentional duplication between France and History of France.  Having said all that, I think you're doing a great job and I wouldn't object to either way. ) You just created two articles with invalid box characters in their *titles*. Why didn't you fix the characters in the links instead? -The characters from 128 to 159 are invalid, but appear on Windows boxes as apostrophes, dashes, and other such characters. On Unix boxes they appear as boxes, slugs, or nothing. They look like this: ???????????????????????????????? . There is a valid box character; it's used in nested bullet lists. -Have you considered putting the descriptions of all those Funkadelic songs on the page describing each album?  They don't all have unique titles, and besides, many of them look puny on their ownI think they'd be more impressive all on the same page with the CD info.  Just a thought.   19:39 Oct 19, 2002 (UTC)Ok, that makes sense.  I just didn't know what your plans were.  I'm not particularly fond of stubs either, though I know sometimes there are good reasons to create them.  It sounds like you've got it under control though.  -)  You might consider starting another wikiproject for your template.  See e.g. http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=wikiproject for the list of ones that are started already, though I note that movies still aren't (Zoe, Eclecticology, I, & others are just playing that by ear, I guess, though Zoe's been doing the bulk of the work).  Anyway, if you started a page specifically for how to write about albums and songs, I'm sure you'd get a good dialogue going about how to do it.  lol  04:17 Oct 20, 2002 (UTC)Thanks again for your efforts at Politics of Canada.  It proves that with a co-operative approach, a lot can be accomplished.  For now I'm inclined to leave the National Unity part of that article alone for at least a couple of weeks.  As You have rightly said, there are still a few holes in that part.  Let's just hope that DW doesn't step back in with his POV's.  Some refactoring of the talk page may be a good thing but there's no hurry for that.  17:57 Oct 21, 2002 (UTC)I finally bothered to look at my talk page and saw your query. Have left a brief answer on the Politics of Canada talk page....DWI started last night editing the Politics of Canada page. I plan to do much more and try to give it a better flow. However, the opinion of a non-Canadian who says he knows little of Canada is very important. As such, please leave me your thoughts on my user page  and I will be glad to address anything I can. My goal is to give an NPOV understanding for the world wide viewers to this great site. Note that I use the words \"Separatist Government\" to clearly define that the matter at question was done by an elected government whose sole purpose is to separate from Canada vis-a-vis the beliefs or actions of a majority of the citizens of Quebec. Example: \"''Quebec'' did not sign the or ''Quebec'' believed etc., etc.\"  The person who wrote this page had a mission and that was to gain a positive view of Quebec separatist's actions by expressing their goals as those of all Quebeckers. Thanks....DWHi, Tokerboy. I made your requested change to the U.S. presidential election, 2000 article. I used Internet Explorer 6.0 (IE6) to make the edit.My browser of choice is Opera, but it cuts off textbox edits at 32 KB. So whenever I edit a ''really long page'' I have to use IE6.Your \"special helper\", Why did I remove the changes?  They weren't really germane to the article.A better expression might be:All Christians have a common set of core beliefs, including sacred inspiration Bible.  These core beliefs are not shared by non-Christians.All Muslims have a common set of core beliefs, including sacred inspiration for the Quran and Hadith.  These core beliefs are not shared by non-Muslims.I know I'm new to the project, but I've been a professional or semi-pro writer since 1981.  I have a cold, i'm a bit delirious, you'll have to pardon the stupid mistake.  That was not the bot, that was me merging in information by hand (no more bot for that for a while) )  I read Odin. the norse mythology is off.  the valkyries have never been vampires, the einherjar have never been cannibals, and frigg is not the mother of thor, or of others on your list.    The root of 'odin' usually connotes 'frensied inspiration'.I noticed you've been using a couple of album covers: are they generally okay to put on Wikipedia, copyright-wise?  u like the shroomz?  00:45 Nov 8, 2002 (UTC)Thanks for your work on American Pie. I love that song! I love love.  Arthur Lee is tops!   02:41 Nov 16, 2002 (UTC)I did not molestrate that Nazi child, but I did hold some Republicanoid heads under water until they stopped bubbling.  Is that molestration?  For Will Smith (who I also hate, for similar reasons) acting well, or at least better, check out \"Six Degrees of Separation\", which was out in 1994? or some such. It's been a long time since I saw it, though, so he might suck. The movie is also mediocre, and makes some inane point about life that I never quite figured out. On second thought, skip it, but just for the record - he doesn't always suck so bad. Hi Tokerboy, I've written some articles on the Australian band Yothu Yindi, including their albums. They have one called Freedom. But apparently Neil Young has one too. So maybe I should name it Freedom (Yothu Yindi album). Since you seem to be involved in this album project, I'd like to know your opinion. Thanks.  19:16 Nov 19, 2002 (UTC)Thanks for the welcome Tokerboy. I'll leave the album as it is now. As for becoming involved in the albums project, consider me a freelance participant rather than a full-fledged one. I've got some Midnight Oil albums which I want to include in Wikipedia. I don't really know what I'll do after that...  19:34 Nov 19, 2002 (UTC)The album stuff is proceeding fine.  I just marked up ''Highway 61 Revisited'' as promised.  Do you have any idea about influential singles, or was that before your time?  I wrote one up \"Love is Strange\" because the cosmic coherence just knocks me out.  I also have started articles on the First rock and roll record, rock and roll anthems, and roots of rap music.   04:57 Nov 20, 2002 (UTC)You had to ask:melody = the tuneharmony = the chords and notes that fit with thembass guitar = key instrument, provides rhythm and also sets harmony, can also be string bass, tuba, organ pedals, whatever''Odyssey and Oracle'' absolutely flows pure music. My copy is temporarily missing, but here's what the New York Times said in 1998:\"Over the course of the ensuing decades, (The Zombies) final album...'Odessey and Oracle' - a beautifully arranged, harmony drenched pristine pop paean to memory, the changing seasons, the passage of time and lost love - slowly began to be recognised as one of the greatest albums of the 1960's.\"Hi Tokerboy. I just noticed the you moved an article from \"Verve\" to \"The Verve\" by cutting an pasting. I just thought I'd let you know, that you can select move page \"Move this page\"  from the left of the window. This will move an article and talk page and preserve the history as well as redirecting the old page to point to the new one. If you already knew this then I'm sorry for the intrusion. Regards  20:21 Nov 20, 2002 (UTC)Howdy. Regarding the Harry Potter page, I have no problem with your change other than I think it could be taken two different ways, grammatically speaking. It's a good idea though, and I think it increases the NPOV of the paragrapgh. You are now a sysop.  23:55 Dec 3, 2002 (UTC)Sorry about your strange messages since being made a sysop. Want me to undo your sysopness temporarily and see if the problem goes away?  00:43 Dec 4, 2002 (UTC)Good work on Willie Nelson.  I just added a bit about his beat-up old guitar.  -)  (have you seen it!?)   05:25 Dec 4, 2002 (UTC)Thanks for the explanation on Talk:Psychopomp.  I'll leave things as they are, so the talk page serves as a guide for anyone more expert who wants to resolve this.   12:10 Dec 11, 2002 (UTC)Wow. You beat me to creating an article on The Afghan Whigs, probably my favorite band. Thanks! Now to add a few, er, colorful facts: such as the band formed when Dulli and MacCullum met in jail; which band saw them performing in Cincinnati & told Sub Pop to sign them up; Dulli's moodiness; & (if I can remember which song that was) the fact they missed breaking into the big time because they refused to sanitize one of their songs so it could be played on top 40 radio. Just another great band that no one has ver heard of.   16:55 Dec 11, 2002 (UTC)Thanks for edits and feed back to Culture of New Zealand.  This was my first significant article and I am surprised at how little was changed.  The only change I take issue with is the link for Kiwi bird being changed to Kiwi - a disambiguation page. See Talk:Culture of New Zealand for more details and comment.   12:29 Dec 30, 2002 (UTC)Tokerboy, regarding the articles you're moving to \"correct\" the capitalization (Keep The Faith to Keep the Faith). Many of these articles names are exactly as they appear on album covers and in official material. I'm not saying flat out that it ''shouldn't'' be done, but the fact that these have established capitalizations should be considered. And \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" to \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" is just ugly. )  07:57 Jan 2, 2003 (UTC)Tokerboy,  Do you know if Fountains of Wayne (the band) is named after the store ''Fountains of Wayne\" in Wayne, New Jersey - its a surreal sort of place, very big on Xmas and seasonal stuff, and I'm betting there's a connection.   08:00 Jan 2, 2003 (UTC)Ah, well, I'll bet they are, I'll have to check out the cover to see if the store is pictured on it....too big a coincidence I think for it not to be the reason!   08:06 Jan 2, 2003 (UTC)Are you sure Wham! should redirect to George Michaels?  Weren't there other people in the band also?  Interesting.  Are you sure the others don't redirect to the singer's page simply because they're named after the singer?  ... Led Zeppelin doesn't redirect, nor does The Beatles (or, for that matter, The Monkees).  But at any rate, you're much more involved in the music articles than I am, so I'll defer to your judgment.  Cheers,  So many of your music biographies seem to end \"his career was essentially over\".  In the first place, almost everybody has their little day and moves along to make room for the next one, and, in the second place, many of the \"essentially over\" people keep having their careers, appearing before adoring audiences, but just don't have any more hits.  Fabian has been out there with that pretty smile for forty years.  Fabian's mother says Fabian is busy, too busy to come to the phone, Dr. HookFrankie Avalon is currently touring in \"Grease\", still playing \"Teen Angel\".   Greetings. I notice that you have been removing phrases such as \"His Royal Highness\" and \"Her Royal Highness\" and so on from articles about members of various royal families. Is there a reason for this? Regardless of what one may feel about the validity of the institution of monarchy, if these honorifics are part of the official titles of the people in question, they should be included in articles about them, shouldn't they?   16:31 Jan 14, 2003 (UTC)My understand is that \"Her Royal Highness\" and the like is not standard for Wikipedia.  See Talk:Josephine-Charlotte of Belgium. Thanks for pointing out that Talk page. I think  was referring to styles in the body of articles, although I may have to ask about that. I can see why a convention not to include full styles every time a royal person's name is mentioned would be appealing, as some styles can be quite unwieldy, and at least in the case of someone with an article of their own, one can go to their article (hopefully!) to find what their full style is. (For someone without an article of their own, I suppose one would have to deduce their style from the general styling conventions of the relevant country, which should eventually be covered in the Style - Manner of Address article, or in some article linked to from it. I'll have to think about that one...) I can't find any such convention written down anywhere, though. Can you point it out to me?However, you also removed some styles of people with their own articles from the top lines of the articles themselves, which is ''certainly'' not right. An article on a person who is styled a certain way should certainly say how they are styled. To omit such factual information from an encyclopaedia would be very strange indeed!   23:45 Jan 14, 2003 (UTC)Anytime I removed \"Her Royal Highness\" from the beginning of an article, it was an accident.  I agree that full titles should be used in the beginning (bolded) part of the introduction, just not in the body of the article. Okay, thanks for the explanation! That sounds like a sensible convention to follow, I think.   00:22 Jan 15, 2003 (UTC)I recall ? that you liked the \"gorgeous\" Ms. Binoche. Take a look at Emmanuelle Beart....DWHey, you're someone who knows about these things ... care to add about common collaborations among hip hop groups?  e.g. Goodie Mob and OutKast work together frequently; there's no mistaking that one man's voice from Goodie Mob (the one who sings on \"Beautiful Skin.\")  I'd do it myself if I knew the names of the various members.  best, Can you add Wikipedia:Check your fiction to Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines? The page is protected.  21:15 Jan 19, 2003 (UTC)Interesting.  Hard to imagine I know more about much of anything in music than you, but I'd recommend The Roots if you haven't heard them, also Nappy Roots and OutKast, especially ''Aquemeni''.  Cheers,  LOL about the Roots/Ja Rule comparison.  -)  My point, perhaps not as clearly made as it should have been, was this: Look at what the Amedeo Modigliani article was (two lines of worthless crap), until I spent several hours accumulating information on the Internet, going to the library and reading Ken Follett's novel: The Modigliani Scandal. (Plus, I actually sat in Modiglian's chair in La Rotonde! On Wikipedia, in two seconds, the ZOE's of this world can destroy hours of hard work. That is not \"improving\" an article in progress, that is a clear message to discourage people from contributing. And no one on this site works harder than me....DWIs there a place for \"disputed\" suicides? That is, deaths ruled suicides by the city fathers but disputed by some; or vice versa, like ruled an accidental overdose but was a \"covered-up\" suicide. It would be interesting to put the Vince Foster death into the ruled-a-suicide-but-really-looks-like murder category. It could open a whole can a of worms  put that in yer pipe and smoke it, eh?

Well Im trying to get my ban removed so I'm simply making an effort to attone for me heinous crimes. I would like a petfrog! You should come give me an allstar reccomendation on the mailing list! JWales said I could come back but only if the community will accept and unfortunately I don't think much of anyone that uses the mailing list is very fond of me.  \\ The official website of the programme calls it ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?''. Doesn't that mean that that is its official name?   18:43 Feb 5, 2003 (UTC)Tokerboy, I posted a response to your query on the Semitism talk page.  But I think the main point is, if you look at the first version of the article, I think Stevert has just made the whole thing up  if anyone else uses the term \"semitism,\" and I just never heard anyone use it at all, I do not think they use it the ways the article suggests.  He's coined his own new word.  But Wikipedia shouldn't be a venue for our own inventions. Classic. Fundamentally classic. )-That's OK Tokerboy- I knew you hadn't done it deliberately, I would have stuck around but I was very tired and wiki was running very slowly last night for me, so I went to bed... Cheers  09:16 Feb 7, 2003 (UTC)I am not interested in discussing with racial supremacists. I defend my moral clarity. /MarthaOh, dear.  A True Believer.

(and a naive 16 at that) Apologies.  When I moved those songwriters, I was unaware that there was already an entry for singer-songwriter and a list that you'd started.

This meant the succession of the Yuan Dynasty. So Hong Taiji became Emperor, changed the dynasty's name to Daicing, named himself \"gosin onco hūwaliyasun enduringge han\" in Manchu and 寬恩仁聖皇帝 in Chinese, and made the era name \"wesihun erdemungge\" in Manchu and 崇德 in Chinese (I forget Mongolian counterparts).

As it stands right now, the first sentence does not even mention that Tokyo is capital and largest city of Japan as well as being at the center of one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world. I think that would be more interesting to know than the fact that Tokyo is 2186.9km² in area. Is something like the following acceptable? '''Tokyo''' (東京, literally: \"eastern capital\") is the capital and largest city of Japan. A little more than 12 million people live in the city while hundreds of thousands of others commute everyday from surrounding areas to work and do business in the city. Tokyo is the business center of the country as well as being the home of the Japanese emperor and the seat of the national government.The city is well known for its highly modern skyscrapers, thousands of flashing neon signs, a bustling network of roads always filled with traffic, and a very extensive underground railway system. ''[expand some more]''Tokyo occupies the ''Tokyo prefecture'' (東京都; Tokyo-to, Tokyo prefecture), which is located in the Kanto region on Honshu island. The prefecture is sometimes referred to as the ''Tokyo Metropolitan Prefecture'' or ''Tokyo Metropolitan Area''. This stems from the fact that the character used for ''prefecture'' for Tokyo differs from the character used for other prefectures.Tokyo is often considered part of the Greater Tokyo Area, which consists of Tokyo prefecture itself and the surrounding prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba. The Greater Tokyo area is the largest metropolitan area in the world having a population of 33,418,366.\n",

            "Why did you move Münster to the oddly-named Münster (temp)? I'm glad you're asking. I screwed up. The plan was to have \"Münster\" (with the umlaut) to be the main entry and have \"Muenster\" redirect to Münster. Since I read somewhere that one should always move pages instead of cut and paste, in order not to lose history, that's what I tried. And now I'm stuck cos wikipedia automatically created a redirect page, and I can't move the other pages to where they should go... can you clean up after me please?  23:21 May 2, 2003 (UTC) Is that right now?   23:32 May 2, 2003 (UTC) Yes, thanks very much. I'm sorry for causing the hassle... is there a correct way to exchange two pages? It's the first time I've tried this.  23:34 May 2, 2003 (UTC) For future reference, the ideal approach is to have an administrator (using this particular case as an example) delete the old Münster redirect, then move Muenster to Münster after that's done.   OK. I'll do some cleanup with the pages pointing to the redirect now... Thanks again. If you can find the time, Muenster (region) has the same problem... I won't touch it. -)  23:37 May 2, 2003 (UTC) You should have no problem doing that one all by yourself, since there's no Münster (region) redirect yet.   23:39 May 2, 2003 (UTC) Whew, it worked this time. Thanks again. -)  23:41 May 2, 2003 (UTC)Just noticed that there's an article at pangram and at List of common phrases that contain all letters of the alphabet that probably should be merged. Feel like having a go?   01:48 May 3, 2003 (UTC) I already added mine to Wikipedia:Votes for deletion. I have linked to pangram from typeface instead. Thanks for the pointer, I learned a new word. -)  01:58 May 3, 2003 (UTC)I made a redirect to pangram from \"list etc.\".  If it gets deleted that's fine, and if it doesn't, that's fine too.   02:00 May 3, 2003 (UTC)I think I've taken care of Hermann Göring...hmmm... interesting sentence! Just needed a move, because the page only had a redirect with no history, so I didn't need to do a delete, so you '''should''' have been able to move the page yourself.  (Just telling you in case the same situation comes up again, I was happy to move it for you! You should feel free to ask me to help out wherever you see a need).   18:38 17 May 2003 (UTC) OK, I'll try myself next time. Thing is, last time I tried I got the \"page exists\" error for the target, so if I understand you correctly this depends on whether the link has a history.  18:40 17 May 2003 (UTC)That's the way it's ''supposed to'' work.  So if it looks like there's no history, only the redirect, you can give it a try.  You won't hurt anything, and if it doesn't go you can always ask for help.  (I usually misspell the page I want to move it to...making more of a mess to clean up. I'm always happy when it goes well)..   18:55 17 May 2003 (UTC) Thanks again. There are several pages where the German umlauts have been incorrectly used, and sometimes when I find one particularly annoying, I try to clean things up a bit. German names are quite frequently actually spelled with \"oe\" instead of \"ö\" (or with other umlaut circumscriptions, for that matter), and really the two are different and can even be pronounced differently in certain cases... it's very confusing, and I'd rather see it correct. As an example, consider the city of Soest, Germany, which is not pronounced as \"Söst\", but \"Sohst\" rather, since the \"e\" here has the purpose of prolonging the vowel. You'll find that in a lot of German names. Finally, certain Germans are actually spelled Schroeder instead of Schröder... circumscribing umlauts therefore adds to the confusion, in my view. -)  19:21 17 May 2003 (UTC)At the 21. may you wrote that germany hasn't a bicameral parliament. What is the Bundestag and Bundesrat in your opinion? The Bundestag is Germany's Parliament. The Bundesrat is a special institution that represents the interests of the Bundesländer at the federal level. It is not a parliament nor a part of a bicameral one. Its members aren't elected, they can't vote whatever they want, they don't even participate in all the legislative procedures. I tried to explain it on the Bundesrat page. You will find the same classification in any textbook on Germany's constitution.   18:31 26 May 2003 (UTC)Thank you for the information. I read the official homepage and you are right!Sorry, my fault.HAllo Ulrich Schön, dass wir beide ähnliche Interesse haben, oder?  Obwohl  gibt es ein Paar Leut' hier, die mich nicht glauben, ich habe meine Doktorarbeit über die Karolinger im Fuldagebiet geschrieben.  Auch wohnte ich in Deutschland für vier Jahre.  Das erste Jahr, war ich DAAD Stipendiatin bei der Uni Augsburg, danach habe ich als Sprachlehrerin (Englisch, natürlich  man sieht wie schlecht mein Deutsch ist!) gearbeitet ...Anyway (sorry, I can never resist practicing, but don't want to be obnoxious about it), I'm sorry about the links  I missed that part. OK, I'll fix that back then.    23:27 30 May 2003 (UTC)You're right, of course, that they don't need repeating.  As far as the rest, there was some method in the madness when we started all of this.  We wanted some overlap, but not much, so that we could keep the articles short and to the point.  The idea was that people would follow the links if they wanted to know more, and also, they would be able to search under more terms.  Then we started getting people who were interested in List pages and got the dynasty things ...  At any rate, I still like the idea of several shorter articles, but think some could be consolidated.  AS far as the bloody French Monarchs, I don't think it's a French/German dichotomy  just a problem over the definition of France and French.  To me, the Merovingians are Frankish, as are the Carolingians  They aren't \"French\" or \"German\". Yeah, sure. -) I just get the feeling some Francophiles are fearing that their history is taken away from them. -)   23:27 30 May 2003 (UTC)BTW, what's your interest ing the Franks?  It's not *that* common!  Look forward to working with you on these   Just a hobby. I did a bit of research on the Holy Roman Empire when I was still in University, mostly in studies of Legal History... one of my papers is online, if you are really interested. Anyway, to get a grasp on that, it's a good idea to know your way around general history too. The thing is that Charlemagne is such a mythical figure in medieval Germany that it's hard not to stumble over the Franks at one point. Besides, I grew up in Osnabrück, which was founded by him.   23:27 30 May 2003 (UTC)Just looked at Carolingian Empire  I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but the more I think about it, I think this is not a good idea.  What if someone wants to know about the Carolingians, or the Carolingian Empire  I know they will eventually get the information, but doing it through re-directs is not intuitive.  I can well imagine someone looking for a quick bit of info, being redirected to Franks and either: a)getting annoyed because he is totally aware of any connection; or, b) having to scroll all the way down to get to the Carolingians after wading through Rome and the Merovingians.  EIther way, it could make this user not want to use the wikipedia.  COuld we please put some of each article back, at least?   Well, my approach so far has been ''structure''. I am not opposed to having many articles at all. I am aware that people might stumble over the word \"Carolingian\" and just want to know what it means without having to read a dissertation about Frankish history. However, I am opposed to having many articles all saying similar things, but varying in little details, which forces the user to read all of them and effectively contrast them to get the whole picture. The lists of Frankish/Merovingian/Carolingian rulers I mentioned on your page really bother me for that reason. Another example is List of German Kings and Emperors vs.  List of Holy Roman Emperors. It seems that some writers did not quite grasp that a German King did not stop being king when crowned Emperor, or even that being king was a requisite for becoming Emperor. Anyway, what I have been ''trying'' to do so far is to have little articles on specific issues and a \"big picture\" article with all the details for those who are really interested. Which is why, for example, I shortened the Merovingian article and clearly point the user to Franks for the big thing. I don't mind doing the same thing for Carolingian Empire, but the article that I replaced clearly did not succeed in doing that. I have changed the redirect for now to point to Carolingian instead, but IMO that page needs a rework too.   23:27 30 May 2003 (UTC)That makes sense  maybe we can work on it together?   I'd love to. Always happy to meet people interested in history. -) I was thinking that maybe the various Frankish rules in Neustria etc. could be merged into one page somehow, maybe with the use of HTML tables to make the connections a bit more obvious. I could try this on a sandbox page first.  23:54 30 May 2003 (UTC)Mr, User:Djmutex, I do not think it is appropriate to be asking  what to do on the pages that are either under discussion or linked to them that could result in much alteration. Ms. Kemp is equal to all and has no special authority at Wikipedia in these matters. Like Ms. Kemp and all users, you should follow the established Wikipedia policies. Thank you, sir.  23:44 30 May 2003 (UTC) Hey, I just asked her how I could ''avoid'' stepping on people's toes. I was not aware that ''asking'' her would already cause trouble. I am not implying any hierarchy whatsoever, nor am I suggesting any ''semantic'' changes to any text. I am only trying to get some structure into a number of articles that look like a bit of a mess to me. Is there anything in particular that you are worrying about? And what policy are you referring to?   23:54 30 May 2003 (UTC)Thank you, I was not directing anything at you personally. Go to the Main Page to follow the various policies and procedures and if you can'ty find the answer, post it on the Village Pump and someone will always point you in the right direction as to where it can be found. If there is no sufficent answer, the policies will tell you where to go to get one. Good luck.  00:03 31 May 2003 (UTC)If you have the inclination, (and if you've read the Harry Potter in the original German), you might be able to supplement what I've started at Harry Potter in translation (really just a way of me finding stuff out, but...)   20:53 30 May 2003 (UTC) I am sorry, I'll have to decline. -) I haven't read any of these, nor am I planning to. But if you are looking for the German titles, amazon.de might be of some help?   21:18 30 May 2003 (UTC)Well, one can't know everything  I suppose. Got the titles, looking for character names, but  let not your heart be troubled, I shall find them elsewhere!   21:22 30 May 2003 (UTC) I currently have my mind spinning over The Matrix Reloaded and was quite disappointed to find no real attempt at resolving all the philosphical references in Wikipedia. For a minute I thought about writing a couple of things that came to my mind, but then I stepped back and figured it would be the safest way of starting a first-class edit war. -) As of now, imdb.com has more than 1700 comments already, which slightly troubles me.   21:34 30 May 2003 (UTC)Not a big fan of The Matrix, so I haven't seen it Reloaded.  The philosophical references were fun, but it was a little too inchoate for my taste. And I would have liked some explicit Gnostic references...they didn't mention the ''pleroma'' did they? __  23:14 30 May 2003 (UTC) Erm, I'm overwhelmed. I'm not an expert on philosophy, so all I know is that some have seen references to Gnostic philosphy in the Matrices, but I certainly wasn't able to spot that myself. Something that hit me however are the  religious connotations, such as Neo being an obvious reference to the Messiah (see also Aeon) and (especially in \"Reloaded\") the permanent hitting on human choice vs. providence and/or fate. My personal theory is that Matrix might actually become a very Christian movie, and so far I have seen nobody elaborate on that anywhere on the Net. -)   12:10 31 May 2003 (UTC)Hi Djmutex SO far, I like what's on the sandbox.  The only thing I might add at this point are explanations of how one kingdom turns into four, and that the Carolingians are Mayors of the Austrasian Palace.  There are other leading families providing MAyors, especially in Neustria  it's one of the reasons Pippin needs papal validation of his kingship.  Really nice table work, too!   17:09 31 May 2003 (UTC) Thanks! About your concerns: a) Yes, the various splits should be explained, and I will add a brief explanation. But the details should really go on the Franks page, I think. b) You probably know more about the Carolingians' rise to power than me, but from what I gathered, the Carolingians were first Mayors in Austrasia and became thus mayors of the entire realm when it was reunited under the later Merovingian kings, or am I wrong there? —  17:27 31 May 2003 (UTC)Nope  I just couldn't tell you off the top of my head when it happened! And there were rivals, I believe  including many who  became their leading men or who married into their family \n",

The result of his first campaign (101-102) was the siege of the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa, and the occupation of a part of the country; of the second (105-106), the suicide of Decebalus, the conquest of the whole kingdom and its conversion into a Roman province. The history of the war is given in Dio Cassius, but the best commentary upon it is the famous Column of Trajan in Rome. The province was limited to Transylvania and Oltenia. It was under a governor of praetorian rank, and Legio XIII Gemina with numerous auxiliaries had their fixed quarters in the province. To make up for the ravages caused by the recent wars colonists were imported to cultivate the land and work the mines, and the old inhabitants gradually returned. Forts were built as a protection against the incursions of the surrounding barbarians, and three great military roads were constructed to unite the chief towns, while a fourth, named after Trajan, traversed the Carpathians and entered Transylvania by the Roteturm pass. The chief towns of the province were Colonia Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa (today Sarmizegetusa, Hunedoara county, Romania), Apulum (today Alba-Iulia, Alba county), Napoca (today Cluj-Napoca, Cluj county) and Potaissa (today Turda, Cluj county).

Der Disput, den Gallo dadurch entfacht hat, dass er einfach Montaigner Ergebnisse als seine publiziert hat, hat die Patentierung des Hiv Tests um Monate verzögert.

            "The following sentence was moved from the article:In 2000, the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform (''Atarashii Rekishi Kyokasho o Tsukurukai'') treated Jimmu's foundation of the kingdom as historical fact in its proposed \"New History Textbook\" (''Tsukuru-kai'') for junior high schools .It is a typical trait of critics of Atarashii Rekishi Kyokasho that they don't examine the textbook by themselves. Here I quote from the textbook (p.36):神武天皇の東征伝承一つの政治的まとまりが，大きな力を備えた統一政権になるには，通常，長い時間を必要とする。大和朝廷がいつ，どこで始まったかを記す同時代の記録は，中国にも日本にもない。しかし『古事記』や『日本書紀』には，次のような伝承が残っている。This is followed by a summary of the legend.I compared history textbooks.The New History Textbook introduce the foundation myth as a legend.The other Japanese textbooks completely ignore the foundation myth.The South Korean national history textbook explains a medieval myth as a historical fact.BTW you may wonder why the other Japanese textbooks ignore the foundation myth. It is because they are complied by communists or communist sympathizers. That's why Japanese conservatives feel a sense of crisis about education. \n",

            "Don't. That would only make the reader confused. Consider: Central government, which the province authority is a part of, has less authority than on the mainland (due to autonomy). The Province of Åland takes care of some duties of other state authorities that aren't represented by office/officials/authority on Åland (rather due to Åland's small population, than due to autonomy). It is the region (maakunta/landskapet) which has extended authority compared to the mainland regions (not the province).I must say that I didn't really understand what was wrong with the wording I proposed: ''The Åland Islands enjoy a high degree of autonomy, why the scope of the Province of Åland is limited compared to the provinces in mainland Finland.''Compare (from the reference (3) above):''Inom de områden som hör till självstyrelsen utövas lagstiftning och förvaltning av Ålands lagting och Ålands landskapsstyrelse.

I also thought that informing somebody(s) who might consider the higher-level organisation as their patch might bring in a few tips and avoid subsequent angst when somebody reverted the lot!I will go ahead with the merge as discussed (not today - too busy) and strip the corresponding section out of Harmonic analysis.  I'll also tidy up notation - I prefer γ ∈ Γ = G^ to φ ∈ G' myself, but will change additive notation in the group to multiplicative.  I think the merge will work well, given the complementary POV of the two pages.  Then I will start thinking about how HA should be structured and fleshing it out.   Hopefully whatever I do will offend sufficiently many people, thus attracting interest and contributions.Cheers \n",

Orestes, according to Zielinski, is the son of the sky-god Zeus/Agamemnon (the two are identified as the same symbolic being) who overcomes his wife, the earth-goddess Gaia/Clytemnestra (also identified with each other). With the assistance of the dragon Aegisthus (who is only symbolically a dragon), Gaia/Clytemnestra slays her husband, whose murder is in turn avenged by his son.The religion of Zeus/Agamemnon (as in, Agamemnon's royal lineage) is then reformed under the influence of the cult of Apollo, who slays the dragon (Python) birthed by Gaia on Parnassus, the seat of one of her oldest sanctuaries. Parnassus becomes the holy mountain of Apollo, and Orestes himself an hypostasis (identified with) of Apollo \"of the mountain,\" just as Pylades is Apollo \"of the plain\"; similarly Electra, Iphigeneia and Chrysothemis are hypostases of Artemis. Zeus being firmly seated on his throne as the result of the slaying of the dragon by Orestes, the theological significance of the myth is forgotten, and the identifications Zeus-Agamemnon and Gaia-Clytaemnestra are abandoned.In the Homeric Oresteia the soul of the murdered wife has no claim to vengeance, and Orestes retires unmolested in Argos. But the Apolline religion introduces the theory of the rights of the soul and revenge for bloodshed. Apollo, who has urged Orestes to parricide and has himself expiated the crime of slaying the dragon, is able to purify others in similar cases. Hence Orestes, freed from the guilt of blood, is enabled to take possession of the throne of his father. This is the Deiphic Oresteia. But a new idea is introduced by the Attic Oresteia. The claim that Apollo can in every case purify from sin is met by Athens with a counterclaim on behalf of the state. It is the community of which murdered and murderer were members which has the right to exact revenge and retribution, an idea which found expression in the foundation of the Areopagus. If the accused is acquitted, the state undertakes to appease the soul of the murdered person or its judicial representative, the Erinyes.Others attach chief importance to the slaying of Neoptolemus (Pyrrhus) by Orestes at Delphi; according to Radermacher (Das Jenseits im Mythos der Hellenen, 1903), Orestes is an hypostasis of Apollo, Pyrrhus the principle of evil, which is overcome by the god; on the other hand Usener (Archiv für Religionswissenschaft, vii., 1899, 334) takes Orestes for a god of winter and the underworld, a double of the Phocian Dionysus the \"mountain\" god (among the Ionians a summer-god, but in this case corresponding to Dionysus), who subdues Pyrrhus ?the light,? the double of Apollo, the whole being a form of the well-known myths of the expulsion of summer by winter. S. Reinach (reviewing P. Mazan?s L?Orestie d?Eschyle, 1902) defends the theory of Bachofen, who finds in the legend of Orestes an indication of the decay of matriarchal ideas.- all of this stuff is more Aryan race mythology from the turn of the century.  My understanding is that just about all anthropologists and archaeologists no longer believe in a race of superhuman, patriarchal conquerors who destroyed a peaceful, goddess worshipping civilization, and replaced its female god with a male god; whether you want to root for the winners or the losers, it just didn't happen.  This was romantic turn of the century mythmaking, and it's not surprising that this stuff was in a turn of the century encyclopedia, but it no longer is believed, at least by scholars.The bit about Orestes symbolizing the replacement of private vengeance by rule of law might be worth saving, but a new bridge text might be needed that doesn't talk about Aryan sky gods and non-Aryan earth goddesses.    18:53 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)\n",

Why not use ideographic forms instead of trying to make something phonetic out of non-related hanzi? Even zhuyin and pinyin would be preferable to that, dont you think?

J, the point I was trying to make was '''that''' your question was not very well posed, and could therefore (in your view) be missed. This possibility itself may constitute a logical fallacy which I'd be interested in resolving.As for: ''First of all, they were the \"same setting\" (number of degrees Fahrenheit).'' One particular (real number) value of \"degrees Fahrenheit\" is a '''commensurate value of temperature'''. If the two ovens are equal by this measure, then they their temperature '''was equal'''. However, you seem to be referring only to some sort of labels or indicators.As for: ''And by \"calibrated \" I mean that, when you set the thermostat to N degrees, the oven heats up to a temperature of N degrees and remains close to that temperature indefinitely'' Then we seem to be using different notions of \"calibration\". I understand an indicator scale Σ oven and one particular set of real-valued numbers Θ to be calibrated if a map Θ f Σ oven is available as a relation between them: Θ fΣ oven  Σ oven   ⇔ Θ, θ = Θ f Σ oven( σ oven ). If two distinct ovens, A and B, are being considered, each with its own ideosynchratic scale, Σ  A and Σ  B, respectively, and suitable calibration maps Θ fΣ A  and Θ fΣ B  have been determined for both, then we can also consider the commensurate calibration relation between their individual scales, namely requiring that θ = Θ f Σ A( σ A ) = Θ f Σ B( σ B ). Surely it is a fallacy even to consider expressions such as \"Θ f Σ A( σ B )\"  i.e. to apply the calibration map Θ f Σ A of '''one''' oven to a scale indicator argument of '''another''' oven, σ B ...

            "Hello there, welcome to the 'pedia! I hope you like the place and decide to stay. If you need pointers on how we title pages visit Wikipedia:Naming conventions or how to format them visit our manual of style. If you have any other questions about the project then check out Wikipedia:Help or add a question to the Village pump. Cheers!   15:00 Apr 27, 2003 (UTC)On Helmuth von Moltke, you commented: hyphens, not dashes, for time ranges (and best not to use two hyphens to indicate dashes in any case)\".Could you please point me to the formatting rule that prescribes that? In German typography, the rule is to use a long dash for the meaning of \"until\", not a hyphen. Now I'm not sure if this is the case with English, so I am honestly asking. Howdy, djmutexActually, I should have said \"en-dashes\" rather than \"hyphen\" (that is, dashes with the width of an \"N\".)  The \"\" indiction is sometimes used for \"em-dashes\" (that is, dashes with the width of an \"M\".)  If you just stick with a single \"-\" the typesetter or copyeditor will usually make the right choice of \"hyphen, minus sign, en-dash, or em-dash\" according to their style-guide. Our hyphen and dash articles are less than explicit, I'll look it up in the Chicago style guide and share it with you. (I'll put that info here on your talk page, you accidentally wrote on my user page rather than my talk page.   22:59 Apr 29, 2003 (UTC)That someone was obviously me. -) Sorry about that, I'm still learning. Are you watching my talk page or would you rather have me add it to yours or are the two connected anyway? Ah, and we don't make the distinction between em- and en-dashes in German  there is only an em-dash in use here anymore.   2003-04-30Got it, Chicago Style Manual 13th Ed, 5.92:The en dash is one-half the length of an em dash and is longer than a hyphen.  (In typing, a hyphen is used for an en dash, two hyphens for an em dash; in preparing a manuscript for the printer, the editor will indicate where en dashes are to be set.) The principal use of the en dash is to indicate continuing, or inclusive, numbersdates, time, or reference numbers.  So yes, if German uses a long dash in instances such as 1968-72 or May-June 1967, or pp. 38-45, there's a real difference, and in English an en-dash would be standard.OK, then I learned something. We do have a difference then. -)  2003-04-30Hope this helps! I'll see any responses either here or on my talk page, either is ok.   23:08 Apr 29, 2003 (UTC)P.S. (My turn for a question for you!.... Sometimes in German texts a name or word is emphasized by spacing the letters apart (where in English the same thing might be indicated by using a '''bold''' typeface. Is there a word for this?  In German, we call that \"sperren\". I would not know an English translation, since this method of emphasis is not used in English to my knowledge. It has gone out of use in German as well. Its historic purpose was that with the old Fraktur writings in use in the 19th century and until 1945, you would not be able to type something in boldface; since emphasis is most easily recognized by the eye as a difference in \"blackness\" over the text, we just took the reverse: instead of making something darker (through boldface), we made it lighter by adding more space between the letters.  This is off the top of my head, and again, \"sperren\" is no longer in much use.   2003-04-30Thanks, now that's 2 things I've learned today! (yes, I only see it in old books)   01:10 Apr 30, 2003 (UTC)You made me think about this more. http://dict.leo.org (btw, the best English-German dictionary online) gives \"to space out\" as a translation for the typographic meaning of \"sperren\". I have been looking about where this meaning came from, since normally \"sperren\" has the meaning of \"to lock\", \"to lock out\"; http://www.uta.fi/~trjusc/glossar.html#Sperren gave me that with the ''Bleisatz'' (the old means of composition with lead letters), extra non-printing stripes of metal would be inserted between the letters. Maybe we should create an article about all this, I find it interesting. -) HTH.   2003-04-30Yes, it sounds analogous to \"leading\" in typography, except between letters rather than between lines.  I think it might be interesting to have an article on national differences in typesetting... we might have [1] ways of showing emphasis [2] ways of indicating direct quotation (French quillemets, etc.) and find others.... I'm not sure if [3] capitalization of names and titles or [4] alphabetization standards would be pertinant.  That's a very nice glossary site, by the way!   21:12 Apr 30, 2003 (UTC)I think an Emphasis (typography) article would be fine for starters. National differences would be great. I also think that the typography article should not only refer to fonts, but many other fine points like the one we had about dashes vs. hyphens and the like, which is something 95% of people do wrong in German when let loose with Microsoft Word and probably in English too. WRT to the glossary site, it's amazing what google can find for you. -)   2003-05-01PS: how do I insert this automatic date/time thing?If you start the article I'll be happy to add what I can.  You're probably using three tildes to sign automatically. If you use four instead (~~~~) you'll get your name plus the time-stamp.   04:09 May 1, 2003 (UTC)Hah, no, until now I typed in everything manually. I suspected there had to be a better way. ;-)  07:52 May 1, 2003 (UTC) Whew, works. Thanks!Took a first stab at Emphasis (typography); added a few links to the additional typography topics that you mentioned. Doing so, I found that an article on quotation marks already exists; this could use a bit of extension for our purposes, it seems. I have added another bit to your talk page  are you still watching this page, Someone Else?   22:04 May 1, 2003 (UTC)I'm still with you (I'll check periodically, if you want me to see something '''right away''' my talk page will be quicker).  I very much like \"Emphasis (typography)\". (What font are you using for the Fraktur? It's ''very'' legible.  My best effort is image:fraktur.png.  I can't think of much to add to \"Emphasis\"!   22:29 May 1, 2003 (UTC)OK, thanks! There is a \"Fraktur\" font on my venerable Corel Draw 4 CD in both Type 1 and TrueType format (among three gazillion others with exceptional quality, although the CD is unfortunately too old to have the euro symbol with the fonts). Figure 2 was done by creating a chunk of HTML with a  section for ''sperren'', switching the font in Mozilla to Fraktur, resizing the Mozilla window, and taking a screenshot. -) I try to be Microsoft-free... with XFree 4.3.0, font antialiasing has become very good. This is the actual screenshot, without any scaling performed.As said in the remarks in the emphasis article, I can't get the \"s\" right this way, I'll probably have to fire up LaTeX eventually. I seem to remember that there was a package for Fraktur typesetting somewhere.  22:58 May 1, 2003 (UTC)Forgot to ask, how did you do yours?  23:02 May 1, 2003 (UTC)Sort of like yours but not MS-free.  I have about 12 old Fraktur fonts, so I picked one, typed the words in MS-Word, used character-spacing to get the \"sperren\" effect (probably used 8 pt separation, which I'm sure is too much but is more obvious to \"English-conditioned\" eyes), and then did a screen-shot. Then uploaded it and realized I hadn't unhighlighted the text before snapping the pic, but no matter... .   23:14 May 1, 2003 (UTC) Thanks for the quick response. Just for the record, in your screenshot the \"s\" letters are wrong too, just the other way round. -) The difficulty lies in that with German Fraktur typesetting, there are two different letters for \"s\"... the one I used (which looks more like a regular \"s\") is used when an \"s\" occurs at the end of a syllable or word, while yours (that looks like a bit like \"f\") is for all others. So actually, both would have to be used, but I couldn't find the \"f\" one in the Corel Draw font.  23:21 May 1, 2003 (UTC)I think I have one of those (see revised version above, I fixed the one at the end of texts). Let me know if it's right! What's the word between \"ähnlich\" and \"beim\", BTW? The first letter is throwing me.   23:36 May 1, 2003 (UTC)You missed the \"s\" at the end of the second line. Also, to be nitpicking, the spacing before the ''sperren'' section is too small compared to the one after it. This is a common problem when you mark a word in MS Word and then apply additional spacing; actually, you have to mark exactly the space ''before'' the word plus the word itself except the last character, IIRC, and then apply the command from the format menu. (I am obviously not entirely MS-free. -) ) Otherwise it looks good.WRT your question, the letter is a \"w\". My HTML text was:Ein Beispiel für einen deutschen Text in Fraktur, in dem ein Teil des Textesgesperrt ist. Er fällt ähnlich wie beim Fettdruck  gegenüber dem Rest des Textes deutlich auf.Mind the  for the en-dash. -)(< Outdenting) ) You're right, this is a completely non-trivial exercise! I think though that this time I've got it (switched fonts just for kicks, too).   00:11 May 2, 2003 (UTC) Yes, that's it! I'd prefer your version over mine if you switched back to the old font though... this looks more like one of the Old English Gothic fonts, or is it not?  00:15 May 2, 2003 (UTC)The \"usual\" font was called \"Breitkopf Fraktur\": the other was a Gotische font. I  t h i n k  I've switched back to the right one. Is it OK?   00:43 May 2, 2003 (UTC)I see no difference. Did you upload a new image? The term \"Fraktur\" usually refers to the German-style fonts, while \"Gothic\" frequently refers to \"Old English\" fonts. Sorry that I'm being such a bitch here, but if we try to commemorate the Nazis here, we should use a Fraktur. ;-) Compare the image on the emphasis page, which is a Fraktur... the font looks quite different to me.If you grow tired of this game, I can fix this thing up tomorrow in LaTeX too. -)  01:05 May 2, 2003 (UTC)Well, I >>THOUGHT<< I uploaded a new one. I will give it one more shot, though! Please Stand By.    01:07 May 2, 2003 (UTC)If you go here, you should see a variety of fonts.  If you find one that you like, we can delete the others. (Let me know what you think). If you can do better in LaTeX, I won't feel offended!   01:35 May 2, 2003 (UTC)Well, the LaTeX package is external and I'd have to go thru some major hoopla to install it. I have found one among your many images that reminds me most of the 19th century books, so I'll replace mine with the one I picked. I just clicked on \"revert\", I hope that is correct. Thanks for all the effort. -)BTW, I am quite used to reading Fraktur. I am working on a dissertation on copyright law in the 19th century and thus have been forced to read much of this... you get used to it. There is an amazing project at , where they scan hundreds of law books from the 19th century for making legal history more accessible. You can find tons of Fraktur there. -)  01:54 May 2, 2003 (UTC)I can't imagine ever getting used to ''lightening'' of the text serve for '''emphasis''', but then my only exposure is from genealogical stuff... for the longest time I thought that ''sperren'' was just defective typesetting!    02:03 May 2, 2003 (UTC)\n",

Thank you for the welcome!  07:43 Dec 16, 2002 (UTC)Hi Menchi,I noticed you rearranged the first sentence of the article on Chen Shui-bian.  Specifically, you removed a transliteration and rearranged the commas.  Here's the previous version:'''Chen Shui-bian''' (1950-) (陳水扁) or '''Ah-bian''' (阿扁) as he is colloqually referredAnd here's the revision you made:'''Chen Shui-bian''' (1950-) (陳水扁) or (阿扁), as he is colloqually referredWas the '''Ah-bian''' transliteration incorrect?  It seems inconsistent to transliterate the formal name, but not the colloquial.  Also, to the uneducated reader (me) who doesn't recognize the characters, it looks as you're saying that '''Chen Shui-bian''' is the colloquial name and the two sets of characters are perhaps slightly different representations of it.Could you help clear this up?  Thanks,  Hi Dachshund, I've re-edited the sentence to make it clearer.Hi, Menchi. Just pass-by and introduce the florishing Chinese Wikipedia. Have fun!   Thank you for the introduction.\n",

            "Re. Multituberculata: \"(some wikification, KTDykes, pls check whether I did mess up any content?)\"Hi JeLuF,I'll have to check that later.  I'm still more concerned with getting the paulchoffatiids right.  (I messed up the species names with one of the genera myself.  It's easily done!)  If I can do that, (freilich kann ich das.  Es geht lediglich um wie, und ich glaube, dass es nun richtig orientiert ist), then I can happily carry on.I also noticed the original multituberculate entry was exteremly like the 'Introduction to Multituberculata' page of an American university, which is where it effectively came from.  I've done a couple of subtle changes to it.  The original author would still recognize their writing has been heavily 'borrowed' by a Wiki-ist, but it contains several details they probably wouldn't know.  I must swop Meniscoessus for a better Mongolian multi, when I get that far.  (There are some excellent multituberculate fossils from Mongolia).CheersTrevor\n",

I know you have been going back and forth with another contributor on the content  I just made some changes which left some of what (s)he wrote, while trying to frame it.  If you are committed to this article, I have a suggestion: do a google search on \"judeocentrism\" and see if you can parse different ways the term is used by different people (meaning, people with distinct views or interests)  it would take some time but could lead to a meaningful development of the article.

Bruxelles est un peu plus au nord que le milieu de la Belgique (normal, c'est en Flandres ;-)de mes souvenirs (j'ai habité à Antwerpen il y a qlq années), le pays était plutot plat. Meme type climatique. Je ne sais pas ce qui défini le passage de l un a l autre dans ce cas...Note que j habite aussi a la limite bleu vert.So, all these mountainous violet zones (on the right-hand map) define a unique ecoregion ?Zone biogeographique is the terminology used by Directive Habitat. Note that the DH areas are larger and more rough than the ones of NG. They are meant to be usable. But since noone has the unique definition of what an ecoregion is (on the contrary of ecozone pretty well defined) I guess you can say the zones biogeographiques are ecoregions also. So, yes, the violet area is an area considered quite coherent in terms of climate, soil and life.About the other problems, I'll leave it up to you as you are the one who is doing the hard work.

            "'''The story so far (please edit for accuracy)'''Black Widow/JoanB is annoyed that people delete images on the basis that they may be copyright, even though the uploader affirms that they are not breaching copyright. Various arguments have been put forward as to whether or not Wikipedians are legally required to police copyright. Some contributors have stressed the importance of international copyright law in determining this.'''JoanB''': I'm not qualified to decide whether any photo placed here on Wikipedia is copyrighted or not.Joan, what do you want us to say? Copyright isn't easy to understand, the law has changed over time, and the law is different in different countries. I can say the following with a high degree of confidence: ''\"The photograph of Juliette Binoche in question is almost certainly protected by copyright.\"'' Notice that I didn't say that our use was illegal, but that the picture is *almost certainly* protected by copyright.Second, you keep asking how do we know to trust each other when people '''say''' that something is safe to use. In this regard, pictures are no different than text. Every time someone posts some text to wikipedia they are attesting that the text being submitted is safe to use. We usually believe that claim until presented with evidence to the contrary. With the case of photos, however, it is usually obvious that the person posting it wasn't the original photographer, so we end up in these squabbles more often.Finally, you keeping talking about the \"owner\" of wikipedia. I don't think that there is anybody who is the \"owner\" in the sense that you mean it. While there is an owner of the computer that ''hosts'' wikipedia, they do not own the ''content'' of wikipedia. -By owner, I mean the one who is legally liable. Again, I'm not a lawyer, but for certain if someone sues you or me for copyright infringement or whatever else we might do at Wikipedia, they will name the owner in the action, and it is the owner who will pay big legal fees and be ordered by the Court to provide the defendant's computer source. That was what happened in the recent ruling on Kazaa, at least accortding to the New York Times. That is a good question. I guess until a court decides for wikipedia, then nobody knows who would be \"legally liable\". It is easy to imagine that if some court ordered the current host to stop hosting wikipedia, then wikipedia would just move to another host. -''For all practical purposes, the owner of Wikipedia is Jimbo Wales. Should someone else host a fork of Wikipedia, he, she or it (\"it\" being a corporation) would be the owner of that fork. That having been said, there is virtually no legal liability on Wikipedia's part for good faith copyright infringement. Other things being equal, Wikipedia (or a Wikipedia fork) would be required to delete copyrighted material once a copyright claim was brought to Wikipedia's attention by virtue of a cease and desist letter. Accordingly, the only legitimate reason someone should be concerned about uploading potentially copyrighted images is quality control. [Note: This should not be construed as a legal opinion or as constituting legal advice.]   22:58 Apr 16, 2003 (UTC)''But I still own the copyright to all the stuff I've written (unlike the case for GNU, where we have sign over - on physical paper(!) - the rights to our work, thus ensuring FSF is the sole owner of GNU code), so Jimbo owns physical bits but not much of the content. The Wikipedia situation is a little more like Linux, which has literally thousands of separate copyright owners in many different countries.  23:17 Apr 16, 2003 (UTC)I would take it even further: if there is no legal liability: the copyright holders can edit any infringements themselves. No need to bother Jimmy Wales about it. Failure of the copyright holder to remove the infringement constitutes an implicit license for WP to use the image. >;-) If there is '' virtually no legal liability on Wikipedia's part for good faith copyright infringement'' why are people arguing about it and going about upsetting erstwhile contributors like  by deleting their photographs? ''Good question.   23:06 Apr 16, 2003 (UTC)''Amen. It should be possible to be squeaky clean without freaking out. I notice a  apology on  BTW.  23:17 Apr 16, 2003 (UTC) This is why I suggested above (way above now) that there should be a one week time out on deleting images, and a reasonably consistent policy for sysops to follow. The irony is that later the same day I managed to violate my own guidelines by incompetently misreading a date - mea culpa... Another question. If people are going to question others and decide to delete the photos, then how do we know that the photo on the page of  is him? All we have is his say so. See how ludicrous this gets.  Regarding my own photo, if you have ''reason'' for suspecting a copyright infringement, then you could indeed consider deleting it. Perhaps you have seen me uploading many copyrighted images, and therefore consider that this one is copyright? Perhaps you have seen the image elsewhere online with copyright markers all over it? Perhaps there is no information about copyright on the image description page? As a non-sysop, you can't delete the image yourself. Instead, you should (in my opinion) add the boilerplate text from wikipedia:boilerplate text (adding specific reasons) to the image description page, remove the link to it from my user space, and add it to wikipedia:votes for deletion. If you genuinely suspect that it is a copyright violation, then that would be entirely reasonable. Of course, the image has ''not'' been uploaded by a routine violator of copyright, it ''does'' have an appropriate image description page, and you will almost certainly ''not'' find it anywhere else on the web. Thus I don't see that you can reasonably suspect it of copyright violation. Perhaps you should pick a better example? ;-)  To the contrary, that makes it a good example, because now you have to discuss the argument, not the example.  question regarding Boeing copyright summarised at Wikipedia talk:Image use policy/copyright comment about fair use summarised at Wikipedia talk:Image use policy/copyright''\"If people are going to question others and decide to delete the photos, then how do we know that the photo on the page of User:MyRedDice is him? All we have is his say so. See how ludicrous this gets.\"''Paraphrased ''\"If people are going to question others and decided to delete their text, then how do we know that anything User:MyRedDice writes is actually written by him.\"'', to which I answer, we don't know. We believe people until presented with evidence to the contrary. -I would add, it is REALLY important not to let people get the impression that other countries are irrelevant for copyright. This is not to say that they necessarily have to police things, but rather that if they ever do have to or choose to, getting it right matters - and unfortunately a US-centric approach might trip some people. PML.All right, Netesq, why is what you are doing, stopping telling people about non-US copyright possibilities, not vandalism? Granted, the information remaining is correct, but it is incomplete and likely to produce the impression on some Americans that they are covered when in fact they are not. This is not saying that you don't know, but that all should be told just in case. So, what is wrong with telling them?If I don't see an explanation or a reversion within a few days I shall report these repeated suppressions as vandalism. PML.''Please be advised that I am currently in the process of researching international copyright law and its larger implications for Wikipedia. IMHO, such issues should be discussed on the Wikipedia copyright page and *NOT* in the very limited context of Wikipedia's image use policy. If you disagree, then feel free to report anything you want to anyone you want.   02:11 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)''That's my fault  I moved everything from Village Pump to here, because originally it was only about the image use policy. I considered moving some of it to Wikipedia talk:Copyrights, but even now, almost all of the examples and case studies used in this debate have been about images, so I thought we may as well keep it all together.   02:17 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)''Hardly your fault, Tim. PML and I were having a small edit war, and it may or may not have been resolved by my explanation above. In any event, PML has raised a very important issue that  as far as I can tell  has *NEVER* been addressed by anyone. The simple answer is that conflicts of law regarding Wikipedia copyrights would be resolved by United States law, but the question is very deserving of further research.   02:40 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)''Two points: It wasn't about the determining jurisdiction, it was about why we should stop telling people the extra stuff (why remove it without a strong reason for removal?); and, there's the area that I ducked in and did something in once it reminded me, like the King James I Bible, real cases where other countries' rules are stronger (the safe bet is the non-US way, when in doubt). The reasons you gave above are not reasons for deletion of broader context, they are reasons why you would decide any particular case without referring to a broader context. Which is no reason for depriving others of that, as near as I can tell. If I am wrong, by all means show me. PML.I found an article that is totally on point: Conflict of Laws Issues in International Copyright CasesBy Peter K. Yu. Basically, there is no \"right\" answer when it comes to international conflicts of copyright law, and anyone relying upon Wikipedia's GFDL in a foreign jurisdiction does so at his or her own risk. Accordingly, Wikipedia:Copyrights should be modified to reflect this fact, and THIS ARTICLE SHOULD STAY THE WAY IT IS.   04:20 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)BUT, that is NOT \"this article should stay the way it is\". The \"way it is\", as it were, INCLUDES non-US information - or else goes back to holding no information on the point. Anyway, that link relates to someone's view of what is right and NOT to what people should be told/allowed to go and see for themselves. Either way, US-centric is wrong. PML. \"relying upon Wikipedia's GFDL in a foreign jurisdiction does so at his or her own risk\". The GFDL is a licence to use the content in '''any''' medium. Not any US medium. If you are uploading content that is public domain under US law, but copyrighted under EU law, then you may '''not''' licence it under the GFDL.''Not exactly. The GFDL is *PROBABLY* a valid license for content that is public domain under United States law, whether that content be foreign or domestic  the jury is still out on this one  but public domain content may be defined differently in another jurisdiction. In other words, international law has not yet caught up to the concept of public domain content being repurposed via the Internet, and each jurisdiction can  and will  make up its own rules.   14:56 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)'' said above: \"Fair use doesn't even exist in France for instance\". That's not true: . Fair use provisions in France are similar to those in the US.Did you seriously read this page ?Here is some cut and paste this is a quotation isn't it ?III. France A. Fair Use'''Article L. 122-5 of the Intellectual Property Code Provides:When a work has been divulged, the author may not prohibit:(1) Free private performances taking place exclusively in a family circle;(2) copies of reproductions strictly reserved to the private use of the copyist and not destined for any collective use, with the exception of copies of works of art intended to be used for the same purposes as those for which the original work was created;(3) subject to the condition that the author's name and the source are clearly indicated:(a) analyses and short citations justified by the critical, polemic, pedagogic, scientific or information character of the work within which they have been incorporated;(b) reviews published by the press;(c) the diffusion, even in its entirety, by the press or radio-television, as current news, of speeches intended for public delivery in political, administrative, judicial or academic assemblies, as well as public political meetings and official ceremonies;(4) parody, pastiche and caricature taking into account the laws of the genre.B. Public DomainThe duration of copyright under French Law for published works is life plus seventy years.'''I'm going to save my comments on NetEsq's statement above for Wikipedia talk:Copyrights, where a similar discussion is taking place.   11:32 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)Rapport du Conseil d'état à propos de l'utilisation loyale «une telle exception (fair-use) ne s'inscrit pas du tout dans la tradition française en matière de propriété littéraire et artistique. » 17:50 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)So it doesn't fit at all with your tradition but it's part of your laws. I see. So if someone copied work owned by a Frenchman citing \"fair use\", would the owner sue the infringer, expecting the court to ignore statutory law and France's treaty obligations?   01:05 Apr 18, 2003 (UTC) Sorry but the above article doesn't refer to fair use. The title is not a part of the Intellectual Property Code. And the content refers to private use and citation. Is there any treaty about fair use ? I doubt. 07:51 Apr 18, 2003 (UTC)Fair use is a common law concept allowing copies to be made for criticism, research, citation, etc. The US codification of it (Section 107 of the US Copyright Act) is similar in its essential elements to the quoted text above. There is a treaty about fair use: you may have heard of it, it's called the \"Berne Convention\". Specifically Article 10. And next time you reply, please use a language not in Babel Fish. Otherwise it's way too easy )   12:10 Apr 18, 2003 (UTC)I didn't delete anything that seems to be the same strange case of unreported edit conflict that happened to 172. 18:10 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)Not a problem, Ericd. I figured it was a computer snafu, but I wanted to make sure that the deletion was not intentional. I'm sorry this came across as an accusation. Mea culpa!   18:19 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)I've just removed something from the policy page about \"If you use images from the US based Wikipedia in other countries' Wikipedias...\" there is no such thing as the \"US\" pedia. All pedias are international.   09:41 Apr 18, 2003 (UTC)I think that's missing the point. It's not about the encyclopaedia aspect, it's about the mechanics of publishing and how that brings it under this or that effective power and/or authority. It seems at least dangerously misleading only to cite US copyright and thereby risk other dangers coming up. At least if no warning is given, reasonable people know they are on their own - but if only US stuff is cited (which has to do with enforcers at the door, not -pedia issues) reasonable people might make the mistake of thinking they have complied with what they need to, when they have actually talked themselves into trouble. That is what I want presented round here, and (say) Netesq's approach just doesn't address that. Frankly, I see no reason not to leave things like that in, even if they are irrelevant. And if they are NOT - well, it's one of those \"don't bet what you can't afford to lose\" things. Netesq and Tarquin aren't settling the substantive matter, so it remains a bet. PML. ok - then someone reinstate that note, but say \"All Wikipedias are international - don't assume that merely US law is sufficient\" - or something. It was a fair warning to give people, but rested on a fundamental misunderstanding. This is just a problem with PD though. If it's your picture or text, it's yours all over the world.   10:24 Apr 18, 2003 (UTC)Please note that the following disclaimer already appears in this article: '' Please note: this is not the official copyright policy - merely a reminder and additional tips ''As such, there is no reason to discuss international copyright issues in this article, and it is clumsy and cumbersome to do so, inviting all sorts of pointless discussion.  However, an appropriate disclaimer in re international copyright issues can  and should be  discussed in the context of the Wikipedia:Copyrights article.   14:02 Apr 18, 2003 (UTC) I agree (hey, I wrote the note).

Could you explain it to me in english? Steve, when you get back, please think about how you can contribute without yanking RK's chain so much. You know he's sensitive; please try not to irritate him. Remember, \"A soft answer turneth away wrath.\"  15:44 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)No idea what u mean by vandalized. i was making a test.  06:03 Feb 13, 2003 (UTC)I have restored all the information Jennifer presented, based on her comments and Danny's added info. Based on these arguments you have swayed me to your position: I now agree with you that it would be appropriate to discuss this in the entry on Jewish fundamentalism. I was using too restricted a definition of this term. Well done, Stevert, on calling the cops re that suicide note. I hope everything worked out OK for that guy. Even if it was a prank (and we had no way of knowing) you did the right thing.  00:33 Feb 16, 2003 (UTC)Hey that Happened on 2/16 may be it was a prank by Two16Some questions regarding recent articles: John Draize redirects to a non-existent article. Why? This obviously cannot work. Any press is good press is not even a dictionary entry. It is just a phrase, the background of which is better placed in an article about media, press, publicity etc. The one sentence pseudo-stub doesn't state anything non-obvious. Why did you create that one? Political regressivism is a term that does not exist in any dictionary or on any website. I seem to recall that you previously added terms which had no verifiable usage; please don't do that.Regressivism is on Votes for deletion, I will add the other two unless you have some good reasons for keeping them.  03:16 Feb 17, 2003 (UTC)What just happened?I shortened the title of that article, - redirecting it to a new page. Welcome to the Wikipedia - nothing stays the same... you should get a username so I can have a face to type to. -You have a good point.  I've always been of the opinion that racists may have good ideas, but they oversimplify.  It's easier to say that the Jews or the blacks or the Punjabis are keeping us good folk down than to know and understand that the money- and power-grubbing elite in every society have always been keeping the common man down, and that this is true from the US to Japan to Mozambique.  Anybody smart enough to become rich and powerful is perfectly aware that racial differences are irrelevant in any meaningful way, but it's easier for ignorant people to blame the Jews or whatever than to really understand the causes and effects of poverty and war. You raise a reasonable question on the Wagner page  what point.  Only someone who has done some research can answer this question.  I am by no means an expert on Wagner (although personally I love his music); I have read only enough to know that many scholars hold this view about his music, so I know a good encyclopedia article will treat the issue.  I am not committed to working on this article beyond making this point.  You seem to be much more active so all I can do is suggest that you read the Bernard Williams' article and Rose's book, and look to see if there are critical reviews of Rose's book and letters to the editor responding to Williams' article, and then you will be able to answer your own question (to my and others' benefit). About the organization of the article  I think there is a matter of politics ''within'' his music (what Wagner was trying to communicate through his music) (and as you point out, some music really ''is'' \"in itself\" political, like much rap and reggae  of course there are different kinds of politics; one can say NWA was political in that it protested the police establishment, and in that it was misogynist  these are two different kinds of politics based on different ways of interpreting music) and then there is the politics surrounding the music (how different people responded to Wagner's music); these should be two sections but I think both are central to the article, and my point is that the first one is central to his music  at least, according to many scholars who have studied Wagner and his music. Hi Sv, Zoe has changed the name of the 'UN security Council and the War on Iraq' to 'UN security Council and the War ''with'' Iraq' , believing the first was POV.  I don't think changing the word 'with' to 'on' solves the problem. ''on'' and ''with'' are both used, the former by anti-war people, the latter by pro-war people. So we have just moved one POV and replaced it for another. I've another suggestion: instead call it ' The UN Security Council and the proposed Iraq war'. That way you avoid ''any'' hint of bias, by dropping all words that could be seen as in any way expressing a POV and instead calling it a term that all sides would be able to use: the Proposed Iraq War. What do you think? I'd welcome your comments on the relevant talk page.  00:45 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)No problem.  I forgot that the server's in a different time zone, though, so the edits I took to be yesterday's may in fact have been recently.  But anyway.  Maybe the discussion will be more calm & civil later.  Hi, just a quick note to that it is best not to characterize anyone in a negative way in talk pages or the summary field  leave me a clean \"paper trail\" of kindness, and it makes enforcing our policies a lotcleaner.  05:54 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC)Jimbo fed me the same line.  In the end, it didn't help, the audit trail was ignored and the easy route taken. Any appearance of Shania Twain on CMT is abhorrent to all that is good and true in the world.  That doesn't mean I've never watched her videos muted, when I hadn't had a date in a while, but that is why God invented Cinemax, not CMT... Did you ever see the ridiclousness at Talk:Country music, where someone tried to claim Twain was \"alt-country\"? vERY BUSY CONGRATULATION ON YOUR RESSURECTION TWO16Stevertigo, it's up to you to keep Iraq crisis, 2003 up to date and complete it.  Obviously it needs to be there.  Just as obviously, Maveric149, TheAnome, JimboWales and Larry Sanger believe that this project is their personal playground, and that their personal biases are far more important than oh say an NPOV statement of all the real issues and consequences around the Iraq crisis.They have shown their pettiness and lack of relevance to the future, and what is more, their paranoia and commitment to \"outing\", labelling, libel, slander and abuses of all kinds.  It's up to you, TheCunctator, and other intelligent people, to keep the project alive.  I suggest you start by advocating the removal of sysop power from the above people on a rotating basis.  Get them to give up the power they abuse, temporarily, and perhaps they will find other ways to overcome their personal inadequacies.  I am quite sure the project will die, dead, if their personal biases and petty choices of priorities are allowed to overwhelm the real goals of the Wikipedia and GNU FDL.Here is some stuff that belongs in the Iraq crisis:- 26 February 2003, Bush commits publicly to a democracy in Iraq;  Saddam Hussein rules out exile in an interview with Dan Rather;  Both sides in the UN Security Council reject Canada's compromise proposal for a firm deadline of March 28 - Germany and France remain committed to \"no deadline\" and the US to push hard on the March 1 deadline for Iraq to begin dissassembling its missiles.Also, the crisis is not specifically about 'Iraq refusing to disarm'.  Taht is the US position/excuse.  The crisis is about the spread of nuclear and large scale biological capacity to a state that is outside the bounds of what developed nations consider predictable, and according to Bush also, the spread of democracy into the Arab world, and curtailing terrorism.  The opening lines should be fixed.The list of impacts needs to be exhaustive, I hope you can manage the task - 142Yeah, but youre a '''nut''' 142, so that makes you all even! ) -Never claimed any moral superiority (the surest sign of actual moral superiority ;-) ), nor powers to enforce it (not necessary if you really are right).  Just want a fair process to apply to actually achieve NPOV.  You are more committed to that than them, and maybe more than me, whatever.  It's more important that the actual Iraq situation be reported in a way that isn't US-centric, or idiot-centric, or nut-centric if you must.  Else it's just more backsliding into cliques.  Scary that you're the only guy objecting to censorship based on *who wrote* an article rather than based on *what it says*... but hey the USA is paranoid these days. Again, best of luck.  142Good renaming of the '''US plan to invade Iraq''' page. My own POV would have been close to the original name, but we need NPOV here and your name is much better.  01:16 Feb 28, 2003 (UTC)Hey, thanks. Thanks for the (I presume) Chinese characters for my user name... I've been trying changing the encoding on my browser but so far have had no luck in getting it to display as anything other than a pair of rectangles. Do you have a handy link to anything explaining what I need to do to see it? Wondering simply, Clueless Frog Yes, Ride+Theory.  See:http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.11/streetcred.html?pg=8Hello. I'm afraid I don't understand how the paragraph which you added to Engrish on 13 January 2003 fits in with the rest of the article. I don't suppose you could reword it a bit, so that I understand what's going on, could you? Thanks! )   03:46 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)Your drawing of the Wikipede is great! danke.  Just a goofy sketch.. -I never said it was wrong to blank pages that have been vandalized.  The pages I mentioned were vanity pages, completely unnecessary but not offensive.  THOSE should not be blanked.  stever, I know you're down, could you find where to put the information at http://www.observer.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12239,905936,00.html and add it to the wikipedia?Nice story, isn't it? I already inserted it onto the current events page, but it'll definitely have to be put in a few of the articles as well. Why don't you (anonymous) do it?  15:01 Mar 2, 2003 (UTC)You've lost me with your comments about tenure.Excellent renaming of the [AIDS kills fags dead] page. As a gay man deeply irritated by that page's name, I am more than happy to see the remaing. *RESPECT* as they say )  23:34 Mar 2, 2003 (UTC)Good renaming job again. I've made two changes. I've replaced the redirect in the two titles 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' slogan and AIDS Kills Fags Dead with the following:For information on Aids Kills Fags Dead and other statements viewed as homopbobia, see Anti-gay slogans Hate speech Homophobia Homophobic hate speechBecause they aren't just redirects now but actually pages with contents, it means that the Cunctator ''cannot'' redirect the page back to either titles, as they both have contents in their own right, not just redirects, without ''deleting the entire page'' and starting again. That was his stunt the last time. Now that option is closed off. Two can play at that game. His 'preferred' title ain't available any more.   03:38 Mar 5, 2003 (UTC)As you know, its very difficult to see if somebody is or isn't in the middle of doing something. I suggest the wikipedia develop some internal chatrooms in which it would be easier to communicate amongst the various users. If we shouldn't be (or aren't) allowed to use non-English characters in sigs then Wikipedia software should detect and reject that kind of change to your profile.  I think demanding english-character-only sigs is biased and NPOV. Hehe.  Accusing someone of a bias is a bannable offense. I agree with you.  But calling someone's opinion \"stupid\" doesn't work very well.  Better to attack the substance of their argument, or their sense of judgement.  If all else fails, drop a \"mom bomb\".  Sorry for the mistake, I spend all day dealing with people who have rather limited persuasive abilities, and I tend to misunderstandimate some things.  I like your new signature, with \"sv\" in it. Helps me distinguish your posts easily when at work ) Hi Stevertigo. If you have such a thing for kanji, I have a suggestion: we currently have pages for latin letters: A, B, C, and Greek letters. How about a page for each letter of Kanji?   13:40 Mar 10, 2003 (UTC)Hello Tarquin.  Your idea is appealing on the surface, but there are immediate issues that come to mind that stand in the way of this endeavor.  To begin with, Kanji characters aren't letters and there is no real concept of a Kanji alphabet.  Instead, Kanji characters are words and are traditionally listed in a dictionary.  Were we to pursue your delightful proposal, we would be in effect creating a Kanji dictionary within wikipedia.  Given that our consensus has already dictated that wikipedia is not a dictionary, you seem to be suggesting that we overthrow an established wikipedia principle.Even if we ignore these social concerns we will immediately find ourselves caught by technological concerns.  Despite your claim to the contrary above, we do not have entries for Greek letters but instead have entries for the ''names'' of Greek letters.  Observe for yourself that we have an entry for \"Psi\", but fail to have an entry for \"Ψ\".  Curiously, clicking on \"Ψ\" incorrectly brings us to the entry for \"Î¨\", which indicates that the wikipedia software itself is suffering from some linking bug.  Attempting to take the tentative first step of writing an entry for the basic Kanji \"日\", one finds oneself instead writing a definition for the meaningless \"Æ?¥\".  Therefore, even an earnest attempt to carry out your suggestion is immediately thwarted.Although we could work out the wikipedia is not a dictionary consensus issues between us, the technical issues present a challenge of an altogether different magnitude.  Because overcoming these problems will require developer status, perhaps your proposal should next be floated to one of the Wikipedia:Developers.Respectfully yours - There obviously seem to be technical problems with page names. But I don't think the \"not a dictionary\" policy applies here  I'm guessing, because I know ''nothing'' about all this  but  an entry on a particular glyph would presumably give a history of the glyph, its evolution, its origins, its usage. That's not a dictionary entry.   18:44 Mar 10, 2003 (UTC)And Tarquin, aside from your idea being disingenuous; 26,ooo hanji treated with the same care as 26 english letters... youre not being sincere...also, for large items, it would make sense only to import them en masse from a data source that already has them compiled, like Unicode, as the Us cities were done... Are us cities the only cities in the world? dont we need entries for each town in the world?.. Aside from all of that, i disagree with the idea that each letter deserves its own article, in principle, and I characterize it as a leftover from Wikipedia's initial testing days... starting out with A, etc.. - Actually, anonymous user, I ''was'' being serious. If SV really wants to educate Wikipedians about Kanji by using it in his sig, he might as educate out readership! I for one would be very interested in reading more about it. I ''do'' think the articles A etc are encyclopedic in nature, as they give the history and meanings of a particular ''thing''. 26,000 articles will certainly be a lot of work. Are there any \"principal\" characters? Do people ''really'' learn ALL of them, or is there a \"basic\" vocabulary? We need answers!   11:26 Mar 11, 2003 (UTC)21:50Mar10,2003(UTC)The above signature best translates as ''\"Long live the Gang of Four! Long live Chairman Mao!\"'' -Hey stevertigo,I need input from someone with a little Japanese knowledge. I'm trying to describe a donburi simmering sauce. ''NI''mono refers to simmered dishes, and I've seen \"donburi ''NI'' shiru\" refer to donburi simmering sauce. But now someone tells me that it should be \"donburi ''NU'' shiru\". do you have any advice?  22:05 Mar 10, 2003 (UTC) (leave message on my talk page, please.)I think you are projecting!  I ''am'' attached to my own desire to understand how other people use their concepts.  Thus, when asked about something like psychological theories into \"attachment,\" I try to find out how psychologists use the term (and why).  I guess one thing I am not attached to is my own navel! ;) I agree totally. He tried to change things around a while ago and I reverted one of his pages. Forgot about the other one, though. great you spotted it. This has to be finally ended. )  05:16 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)哎竖眩君，您到底想不想要汉字门面啊？你如果要，随时给我打个招呼，我不收你钱。唉您哪儿来的翻译系统可以把整个儿英语巨资翻译成洋泾浜汉语？Hi 豎眩sv,  Was the record of the year wrong on Grammy Awards of 2001?  Source: the Grammy web site.  Regards,  17:32 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)Yeah, if you check again, do a search - U2 won 9 grammys, most of them ins 2001, and 'ROTY' was for ATYCLB (sing) - Sign your name on talk pages. -豎眩svI see the problem:  Grammy.com says:Record Of The Year '''2000''' - (43rd Annual GRAMMY Awards) \"Beautiful Day\" (Single)Record Of The Year, '''2001''' - (44th Annual GRAMMY Awards) \"Walk, On\"But those years are not the year the award was presented, they are the previous year (the year records were produced in to be eligible).\"Walk On\" doesn't come up in a search for awards to U2 because it was actually awarded to the engineer and producers (if you search for U2 as the artist there are 14 matches).The same date problem applies to all the other awards on that list - I'll move it to Grammy Awards of 2002.  I'm glad you noticed this before I'd got much further!  I was just about to add all the awards for 1975 (which should have been on the 1976 page)  Thanks )p.s. I ''did'' sign (and date) my first message on this page, do you mean I forgot on another page?  Sorry if so.  Signing again ->  18:29 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)Just popped back to correct my implication that I'd done the list on Grammy Awards of 2002, that was 's work.  I've been working off-line on similar lists for other years and got confused.    19:42 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)Ah, but I ''do'' have the imagination to see the connection between \"attachments\" and \"idols.\"  But to be blunt, I found Marx's and Freud's (as well as many other's from Pietz to Deleuze and Guattari's) musings on this topic far more imaginative, as well as thoughtful and sophisticated, than anything I have yet read on Wikipedia, especially the original version of the articles on \"attachment\" and \"idol.\"  Moreover, they use words rather differently than the way words were used in those articles.  Since I believe people will find far more stimulation for their mind as well as soul by reading those folk, I think that Wikipedia can help by introducing readers to the language used by them.  An analogy: why continue driving in that beat-up Chevy Nova that needs a tune-up, when your thoughts and feelings can take flight (to mix metaphors) in a Lamborghini?  I've been in the Lamborghini of the imagination, and believe me, the original article on idol-worship, and on attachments, felt like trying to walk in the sand, with weights tied to my legs...  I do not mind if the words on the page are in simple black and white  my mind is full of colors, so full of swirling colors, that what to you may appear colorless is in my mind a kalaidescope of tropical fish, bubbles, and stardust. Rachel Corrie photos - you said \"Photo courtesy http://www.palsolidarity.org\" - I just want to check - have they given us explicit permission to use these photos under the GFDL? Or are you just giving the source of the photo without making any statement about copyright? I've heard four different things from four different wikipedians, so I'd like to know what the real story is! ) If you need to make a letter drop use Two16 @ groovy.net will be set up as soon as I go to the research labs. Two16Hey. I just wanted to say that I love your sketches. The Wikipede is gorgeous: typing, reading, reaching for books... It helped convince me to support the centipede. Thus, I comission you to draw more, which you may refuse to do since I have no authority and am not paying you.   21:38 Mar 24, 2003 (UTC)Hey, great to see you back. Where have you been? -)  21:49 26 May 2003 (UTC) Nice to see you back, Stevertigo ) Oh, and since we now have WikiMoney, I'll pay you a wiki-kiss for any sketches you draw for the 'pedia. (admittedly this may rapidly bankrupt me...) My name is not Adam... The best part of the quote is its author. I see that you're the Ambassador for the Japanese Wikipedia, and apparently you know the language quite a bit better than the average bear, so you or someone you know is probably qualified to tackle the translation of Japanese proverbs. - 05:41 12 Jul 2003 (UTC)I am aware this title is stupidly long Steve, but I want this issue at least temporarily solved before I leave. I did not see any proposition I was happy with, and was not able to give one that could be satisfying. I have waited a long time on the talk page, in hope someone else would propose something better. But no one did, and all left to me to choose a title. I thought if I did choose it, that could steer some reaction -) These articles have been renamed so many times already, that one more is really no big deal. As long as nothing get lost in the process. You are most welcome to give your opinion. I will be very happy of any good proposition as long as every one stays polite.et...merci pour le français -) Amicalement''Respect and civility are supposed to win''. It is clear it does not hold the same importance for everyone. I feel tired Stevie. I consider the cost effectiveness of the past 6 weeks, and I am not convinced. So leave I need. Perhaps totally. Perhaps to focus on the french wikipedia. Perhaps to see if internationals have room in the wikimedia. But sure a break I need. When I am done cleaning. Enough windmills, right ? -)You are absolutely right. It is not a cause, but a symptom of a need. The cause just allow the need to raise its head higher. Someone understood at evolution. I don't know if anyone will help at Gaia. If a good title was found, it would be more secure. I will have to count on Slr and 168 to remind people of my opinion. But the more I fix before, the more chance it has to stay. Perhaps. Little hope though.- is it the custom now to not leave signatures? )well. I do not sign often on the fr wiki -) I \"trigramme\" (Ant). Being less active, we communicate less by personal pages, more often on discussion pages. I make the effort here though.  15:29 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)~(yes, I did !)I'm sure JimRegan is a great guy, but I'm not sure he should dictate how that page looks on my machine.  And in case you're wondering, it looks like hell on my machine.  It hurts my eyes.  Ick, I don't like it at Go game either.  It reminds me of a vision test, but one designed by a sadist.  Hm, I think the onus is on the person who wants the color on a page to prove the usefulness and unoffensiveness of the color, rather than the other way aroundespecially given the differences in browser setups.

If you ever need editing help visit Wikipedia:How does one edit a page and experiment at Wikipedia:Sandbox. If you need pointers on how we title pages visit Wikipedia:Naming conventions. If you have any other questions about the project then check out Wikipedia:Help or add a question to the Village pump. Cheers! About those B&W; photos of camerasyou mentioned that you had reduced them to 64 levels of gray at one point and originally saved them as PNG.  Converting to JPG saved a lot of space, but it would be even better if we started with the full 256-level originals and converted ''those'' to JPG; they'd be smaller and much higher quality (the present photos have noticeable aliasing).  Can you give me some idea of what start-to-finish process was used to create these photos, so we can work on making them as high-quality as possible? I looked at folding camera and let me say first that I'm not an expert.  I'm an amateur photographer who started with some (very little) videography around August 2001, and only recently (about six weeks ago) bought a still camera (this after taking one photojournalism class in June).  So.About the article.  It looks ok, except it seems to imply that the cameras are not often used any more.  This may well be the case, ''but'' if it uses even 120mm film, the camera would yield fine images (the larger the negative, the larger the blowup before you get noticeable grain).  A side effect, of course, is that the cameras are heavier.I don't know if this is the same camera as the \"view camera\" (where the photographer disappears beneath the cloth), but ''if it is,'' the ''National Geographic Field Guide on Landscapes'' has this to say about it: they commonly have a 4x5\" sheet of film, and the camera\"records extremely fine detail and yields superb enlargements.  Both front and rear standards can be adjusted to manipulate focus and depth of fieldyou can tilt them up-down and left-right to correct for perspective distortion and to have both near and far subjects in focus.\"\"Most are completely manual, are heavy and cumbersome, and are expensive to buy and operate.  They require patience, skill, and a lot of practice to master.  But photographers who want extremely high definition and who plan to make very large prints find them invaluable.\"I hope this is a help.  I don't know if it's the same camera, sorry.  Aside from point-and-clicks, all of my limited experience has been with the Nikon FM2.  Bestoh, and thanks for your contributions.  -)   04:24 Sep 7, 2002 (UTC)-Well I should expand the article. High end folding camera could be great picture takers and a cheap way to enter in medium format photography. But they don't age very well... There prone to light leak (bellow pinhole) and to film/lens parallelism problems. I will try to add something about the subject. 10:07 Sep 7, 2002 (UTC)I've added something about view camera and something else field camera they also have bellow but are build for different use.National Geographic refers to view camera you can use this source to expand the article. In restrictive sense a folding is an ancestor of the Nikon FM2  a general use handheld camera and use generally medium format film 120/620 or 116/616 (now obsolete). A view camera is unusable without a tripod and use large format plates (4\"x5\" and 8\"x10\" are common size in use today) (glass) or sheet (film).A view camera for stdio use can not be foldedAt large sense a field camera is a folding ; it can be folded. This implies some limitition in tilt and shift movements.I have no pictures for wikipedia but look there http://www.benderphoto.comhttp://www.fiberq.com/cam/misc.htmhttp://photographytips.com/page.cfm/220-btw, ericd and ericb are only one person ?If true, would you be interested in the official WikiProject French departements ?

About  Le Bébête Show: It's considered by a number of Wikipedians useful to have common misspellings present as redirects to the proper spellings.  That way, those who enter incorrect spellings may still get to the article they want to read.  However, if you think this is a serious issue, add it to Wikipedia:Votes for deletion. On that site it can be discussed for  alittle while, and if most agree, deleted.  Right but the search engine don't care about accents it would be better to create Le Bebete Show and to get rid of other misspelling with accents ?On a more general what is the policy with non-english spelling ? Event in the project french departement it seems unclear. I am for French départements, but what ?The general policy is to use the accepted English spelling where there is one. Where there isn't, I heartily recommend using the original spelling with accents (or closest approximation; we're limited to Latin-1 so many non-Western European accents need to be dropped, and non-Latin writing systems should be transliterated of course!), but acceptable variants may be provided as redirects (for German umlauts -> letter+e; for French, dropped accents). -Hi. Eric. I assume the blanking of The Rutles was an accident. The net was very slow this evening I don't know what happened....I don't know who you are, but already you're slandering me.First, I am not a Stalinist.Second, if I have to convince you of what happened in Central Africa or Southwest Africa, then you’re ignorant.Third, if you are at all familiar with mainstream scholarship on Chinese history, then I wouldn’t have to convince you that those Free Tibet charges are extremely questionable.Forth, I’m not here to advocate anything.I'm used to these ridiculous charges from the likes of people like you.User Tannin described them well:\"172, let's not get into a misunderstanding here. I would be the last person to call you a communist. Prior to your arrival, a good many of the history pages were rather shallow things, and showed little understanding of the interrelationship between history (in the traditional \"kings and queens of England\" sense) and the broad flow of economic change that underpins and (in general) controls the actions of statesmen, generals and inventors. You certainly do not fall into that trap! Your contributions have made significant inroads into the task of describing history as an interacting whole. Several others here have objected to what they see as a \"communist bias\" in your writing. In large part, these objections stem from two things:Many people here have spent a lifetime steeped in a rather one-sided view of history - I'm talking about the sort of history that describes the Battle of the Bulge or Second Alamain in loving detail, but relegates Stalingrad to a footnote and doesn't even bother to mention Kursk; the sort of history that thinks Jethro Tull invented the seed drill and therefore we had an Industrial Revolution - and on reading the sort of thing that you write, they (very naturally) tend to say oh, this isn't what I'm used to seeing, therefore it must be wrong. You tend to write large slabs of text which is perfectly comprehensible if one concentrates but far from easy reading, particularly as it is liberally laced with the jargon of political economy. Many people see key words or phrases like \"bourgeoise\", \"hegemony\", or \"accumulation of surplus\" and (a) don't really understand them, and (b) assume that because the two or three Marxist or Leninist tracts they happen to have glanced at are filled with these same words, that the present work is more of the same. \" EricD, sorry to be intruding on your talk page, but I had better point out that the above is a selective quote, and the full version (on 172's talk page) also includes less complimentary points. I shouldn't want anyone to think that the para above is a complete or balanced statement of my views I never wrote anywhere you're a Stalinist.I've been myself suspected to either Stalinist or anti-American and I might well be one ;-).You should know than phrases like \"bourgeoise\", \"hegemony\", or \"accumulation of surplus\" are widely used in marxist discurse and rarely in other discurse.I simply don't like the way you edit article without researching any form of consensus between the contributors.I personnally avoid editing sensitive article without adding comment in the Talk.Have a look at my comment in Talk:GenocideEric, 172 was addressing me. Unfortunately, she/he debates with the equivalent of emptying the clip on an automatic rifle, which while hitting at least one bull's eye, unfortunately causes a lot of collateral damage. Sorry that you got hit.If 172 would try to enter into a debate with the rest of us, perhaps she/he wouldn't be in this situation. (And yes, I know I need to improve on MY debating skills.)   21:03 Jan 2, 2003 (UTC)It was for me to I wrote in several places about his strange understanding of NPOV.Like I said, \"the equivalent of emptying the clip on an automatic rifle\". It would be nice if she/he did more than a cut-n-paste in both logs.   21:15 Jan 2, 2003 (UTC)these terms are widely used in the discourse of politcal economy in general.Sorry, Eric, I'm staying out of any more edit wars until the 172 situation is resolved.  I've just asked that he/she be banned.   I believe it's the only solution. Sure, Eric. First, alas, I have to spend a day at the office. Sheesh, I let the mother-in-law use the computer for a while, & I miss out on the general consensus: that's the only reason I reverted genocide with a few changes.Hope I'm not rekindling the blaze.  Please stop deleting cases of genocide in Africa.I don't delete cases of genocide in Africa I delete tons POV addition you made.I will reincorporate case of genocide in Africa if you cease your non consesual addition. YOU JUST CAN'T IMAGINE HOW ANTI-COLONIALIST I AM !Have a look to my contributions about Jean-Marie Le Pen.I'm not interested in POVing that article about Jean-Marie Le Pen. I'm not interested in espousing a anti-colonialist agenda on Wikipedia. I'm not interested in advancing a Stalinist or Trotskyite agenda on any medium.But if there's going to be an article chronicling instances of genocide, I feel that it should be as complete as possible.\"Terrorisme intellectuel\" is the only way to qualify your behaviour.No freaking kidding. The references to the Congolese economy seem to be throwing you off. This should not be so. As I’ve said earlier, referring to Belgian atrocities in the Congo Free State without referring to surplus value, labor as a commodity and mass-production is like detailing the Holocaust without discussing anti-Semitism.Like Zoe I will stay out of edit wars with you until the your situation is resolved.What situation? If Zoe gets me banned by slandering and misinterpreting my contributions, I'll just get a new username.Positive thinking ! And if you don't change your attitude you'll be banned another time.A round of smilies all around for THAT thought. And I award one Point to Eric.~meeh meeh caheeh Eric, thanks for your comments. I did just look over the material (and all the revisions) and do think it needs work, but I am a little cautious about doing anything with it because I certainly have a POV interest invested here (in my latest employment incarnation, I write curricula on the Holocaust and genocide). In general, and I admit fully that this is my own POV, the term genocide seems to be bandied around a little loosely here. The question I would ask is \"Are politically-motivated killings, as opposed to ethnically motivated killings (and I admit that the distinction is somewhat obtuse) an act of genocide, or is it a crime against humanity?\" For example, if Mao (Stalin, Hitler, etc.) killed 30 million people because they opposed his regime, it is certainly a heinous crime, but is it genocide? It is not a question of comparing tragediesI don't think we ever can or should do that. I also think that certain unquestioned attempts (some which were actually successful) at genocide should be mentioned. For instance, I happen to have a copy of Stannard's ''American Holocaust'' on my desk right now. Many (but not all) of the cases he mentions are clearly examples of genocide and I think they should be mentioned. Similarly, the case of the Herero in Southwest Africa deserves mention, as does Stalin's policy of ethnic cleansing in WW2 (Chechens, Kalmyks, etc.). I'm not sure Mao's purges, no matter how horrible do ''under the heading genocide''. Again, this is my own POV, off the top of my head, and I have to think about it some more and do a little more research. I certainly will do that though. I mostly agree with your point of view I believe politically-motivated killings should be be distinged from ethnically motivated. I also believe that the article genocide should be extensive about historic controversies they should be discussed in separarte article. I also believe that the order is non-neutral. I'm very prudent in editing such sensitives articles (my english is too poor). I generally prefer to make comments.Jumping in this discussion, just to say that I agree too... Confusion is dangerous because it serves propaganda more than it serves understanding. An act may be horrible even though it's not technically a \"genocide\". Exactly my feelings. I dont think the article makes that distinction, which is why it is being used for various POV efforts. Did you read the page?The content pertains to major \"CHARGES\" of genocide.In my opinion Mao, Stalin, and Leopold II did not commit genocide, but the Germans in SW Africa did fall within the parameters of the definition. But this opinion doesn’t matter. This is not for Wikipedia users to decide. Let's not remove anything and simply let’s continue to report what others have CHARGED.You asked for new subject try There's Plenty of Room at the BottomI don't get the insult.How about the charge that Linda Lovelace was the victim of genocide? I understand the Judean Popular Front alleged that.  Bullshit, Maoist propangada supported by US governement.-Be realistic (and better yet start making sense). Doubtless you are familiar with all the charges of genocide in the article, as they are all fairy well-publicized. The occurrences of all those atrocities are generally undisputable as well. The debate centers on whether or not each atrocity falls within the parameters of genocide.It is inappropriate for Wikipedia contributors to pick arbitrarily sides in a controversy.Instead, let’s continue to list well-documented atrocities that some consider instances of genocide. Let's keep the Belgian Congo in the article and Linda Lovelace out.Regarding the Congo article:You people may dislike me, but a brief overview is necessary. The current article goes into micro detail, but gives little insight as to why these atrocities occurred. As a PhD historian, I can assure you that few scholars would seriously assess Leopold’s rule in the Congo without taking the two contrasting concepts of land and labor into consideration. Understanding the contrasting patters of production between the traditional Congolese tribal states and modern, industrial Belgium is essential.You people don’t seem to understand the colossal leap from subsistence, seasonal patterns of agricultural production to the modern capitalist one, based on specialization/productivity and surplus value. Personally, I consider this a form of progress (though not in the Congo context!) and don’t understand why some readers deleted my contributions, feeling that I have an anti-modern bias.Mass-production of rubber in a dense, tropical forest in one of the world’s most isolated regions was after all quite a massive endeavor. Other parts of Africa were not cultivating rubber (quite a harsh crop to cultivate); other parts of Africa had milder climates and topographies. So the whole rapid shift to mass-production of rubber might be considered more important than Leopold’s megalomania and insensitivity.Indeed this was a change (and this change was the export of capitalism) that revolutionized every level of Congolese society forever. That must be noted, considering that this is an article on Congolese history.Few people will remember the micro details of the article just minutes aftwer reading. So our duty is to give them a general overview, an understanding of not just what happened, but why.Just what do you mean by \"PhD historian\"? Do you have a PhD in history? If so, what was your thesis on? Do you teach history? If so, on what level? Is your position tenure-track?In my experience, when someone drags out the fact they have a doctorate in a subject (& it's not an MD), they are covering for their ignorance with arrogance. And the ones with an MD usually are just being arrogant. (Although there are exceptions  like the parents of one of my ex-girlfriends).Doing something about your arrogance would do wonders about your popularity.   21:38 Jan 4, 2003 (UTC)If you don't accept the principe of Wikipedia write an article about Congo in some scientific review.  Stop pasting everywhere an article that's obviously show an attitude. And remember an Encyclopedia is not a Phd. POV is welcome in a Phd not in a Encyclopedia. And anyone who considers himself as being scientific should accept his work to be criticized. And your text is not so scientific it contains a large number of unargumented assertions.Pasting the same text everywhere without changing any word restoring every time someone delete your additions is not a positive attitude.Qualifying anyone that disagree with you as an ignorant or as belgian nationalist is not a positive attitude we have a name for this in France we call it \"Terrorisme Intellectuel\" that's what you do. Even if you feel leftish that's a facist behaviour.I don't deny the exploitation of the Congo that a proven fact. I just believe that qualifying it as genocide is an improper use of the term (the more you use word the less sense it has) and that your text contain a lot of subjective assertions.Re-work your text and try to make it acceptable according to Wikipedia standards put it in an adequate article and not everywhere you can paste it. And believe me you will be much more convicing.Be positive instead of being paranoïd.I expect my poor english doesn't deserve too much the meaning of this text.I wasn't logged in 62.212.103.37 is my ip address.Don't worry. Your English is better than my French.Read the article:History of the Democratic Republic of the CongoSee my new changes and see the talk section please.I’m wasn’t saying that my interpretation of the Congo Free State was the final word, but merely suggesting that few scholars would seriously assess the era without taking the contrasting concepts of land and labor into consideration.I merely ask that the article not convey only a superficial glance of the historical record.I’m just remembering that you said that you’re a Trotskyite.You Trotskyites cost Lionel Jospin the election!\"Terrorisme Intellectuel\", as usual. Disqualifying people for what they are not what they say or write.I never write in anywhere I writed I was a Belgian nationalist. Do you think I'm serious ?Read my comments History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.I can analyse your text word by word to show you that it is very oriented.But you should known  normally when I do this job I'm payed for (bourgeois ethic ?). Wikipedia is hobby for me and for most of the Wikipedian. With your attitude it become some kind of harassing unpayed work.Ericd:I’m not dispensing that energy to salvage a few sentences. I’m dispensing that energy because I started and wrote that article and Vera Cruz is arbitrarily deleting 90% of it.I don’t want to engage in petty, personal arguments with you anymore. I’d rather engage in more constructive dialogue.It’s easy to accuse someone of bias and call him names like \"terrorist\". But what biases are evident in that article? I truly doubt that you’ve read my revised version in its entirety.For sure I don't want to read the same prose anymore, the most oriented sentences are still there.Then don't say that the text is biased and don't call me a terrorist.Read over this is not an insult just a fact.What bias? You haven't given me any examples.You're just trying to annoy me as if you were a small child.Re-read in Talk:History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the same text in New Imperialism isn'it ?).If you  left uncut some of my comments.You often cut what is too disturbing to you.I WON'T ARGUE WITH YOU ANYMORE.That's all folks !Eric, may I suggest you join me on the mailing list in urging 172's ouster?  Go to Wikipedia:Mailing lists.  The discussion concerning 172 is on WikiEN-L.   Ericd, please do not vandalize 172's user page, this is a violation of our policy. And yes, copying large amounts of text repeatedly qualifies as vandalism. It also wastes DB space on the Wikipedia server. OK I will never do it again.Ericd:You’re probably detecting this bias laced in technical language because of language difficulties. I can understand how that's possible, since I speak French and Spanish as non-native languages. I sometimes have a hard time picking up subtleties.Your English, I have to admit, is far better than my French.Pas vraiment à l'état neuf, la 2CV ;-)C'est la plus ancienne que j'ai vu à l'état d'origine depuis 1980 elle a encore sa peinture cellulosique. Elle était garée hier en bas de chez moi.could you rename your photo of the box camera to perhaps one called boxcamera.jpg?  It's not hard to imagine box.jpg being overwritten with a photo of, say, a box used to demonstrate something mathematically.Eric, why did you ask me to look at the Isadora Duncan page? I was querying the copyright status of an image on the Golda Meir page. I'm confused... Because a lot DW images uploads seems copyrighted and he seems to refuse to answers about it ?Ah, right. I'm going to give him the weekend to provide some info on the Golda Meir image, then delete it if he hasn't. All done. (The 2CV copyedit.) I have to say that I found very little to change though - as you can see. And that is a GREAT picture. I love it! Thanks.Who the hell do you think you are removing the photos I inserted on the FLQ members....DWFor photographic lenses, I'd say go ahead and write an article at photographic lens and we'll just add links from lens and lens (disambiguation). I'm assuming that you'll want to write photographic lens from a more practical point of view, and keep lens mostly as a theory of optics type article. Alternately, we could just make lens a disambiguation page, and move the articles to lens (optics) and lens (photography). I don't have a strong preference, although the first option is easier.As for rainbow, I can't see anything wrong with the picture - what makes you think it is a fake? It seems it was added by , BTW.   20:43 Jan 23, 2003 (UTC) I have an impression of strangeness. At second thought The picture show sensible vigneting this is typical of WA lenses with filters. if you want to fake a rainbow with a filter you need to use a WA to have a maximal depth of field). The angle of the rainbow with the ground seems unusual to me, could it vary with latitude for instance ? Is the shadow of the tree oriented  according to theory ? The shape of the bow is a circle centered on the shadow of the observer's head, so the visible part of the bow can be quite \"low\" if the sun is high in the sky. It seems reasonably consistant with the shadows in the picture. -  22:04 Jan 23, 2003 (UTC)DW never responds to Talk.  He only makes rude and ignorant comments then skulks away.   I know according to him I'm brain damaged.According to DW 'Phonies like [me] who hide behind a computer can pretend to be anything and there are always enough dummies around to buy your load of crap.'  Oh dear, have I offended him? I'm sooooory sorry! )))   01:37 Jan 26, 2003 (UTC)Eric,http://www.altavista.com/ found 131 results for 645 film. While not a unique format, it's still a well-known phrase that, I think, should still be clarified in the article. You can even buy 645 film backs. I don't know. maybe you're right. But maybe not. 11:53 Jan 27, 2003 (UTC)131 result is not much try 120 film !On Google 151,000 result for 645 film, 1,410,000 for 120 film, 190,000 for 620 film (obsolete since roughly 30 year). No result for 645 film on the first the first page refers to 645 as film format.Question for you & other photographer wikipedians at talk:f-number and perspective distortion.  Of all the idiots ever to show up on this site, YOU ARE IDIOT NUMBER 1 ! Doesn't your limited intellect understand that this is the World Wide Web? Wikipedia is deliberately open to the WORLD. 04:14 Jan 24, 2003 . . Ericd (Monastere de Cimiez, Nice, France. that's enought.)Your moronic deletion of information that tells people who don't know France or Tibet or Uzbekistan etc. etc. tops it all. Don't you get it at all. Have a nice daysomewhere else....DWEric, please ignore the troll.  01:22 Jan 30, 2003 (UTC)Eric, there is a larger image for this pic \"image:ballcourt s.jpg\" here > media:ballcourt.jpg if you think the article pic is too small.  Maybe edit it and replace with the edit if you think it will help. Both pics are being used for the Chichen Itza article. Eric, your reworking of the ballcourt and castillo images are great! I have PaintShopPro, but couldn't have done half the job you did. Hi there Eric. I've updated Switzerland with the template and saw that you had uploaded a nice image of the Swiss cantons, Image:Schweiz.png. I have removed the link to it however, since I'm not certain whether we are allowed to use it. It displays an URL at the bottom and the site it mentions does carry a copyright symbol. Are you certain we can use it? Merci  22:07 Feb 2, 2003 (UTC)Well, I don't know someone uploaded a bmp and I converted it to jpg. I'm not certain.BTW see Talk:Juliette BinocheLooking at the edit history it appears that GC in fact uploaded the original image. I'll go talk to him then. Thanks.  17:51 Feb 9, 2003 (UTC)There is an edit war going on there right now, Eric. (Race & intelligence.) Not much point in copyediting just yet, I'm afraid. But maybe later.  02:08 Feb 9, 2003 (UTC)Not really an edit war. POV seems to converge but I've added a bad joke in poor English. 02:11 Feb 9, 2003 (UTC) WTF? It made ''me'' laugh. ;) Eric, why did you rename all the MiG entries? There are double redirects all over the place now, and I'm not sure that it's an improvement. My ''International directory of military aircraft'' does not support the move, and a quick Google doesn't either.  21:10 Feb 20, 2003 (UTC)Well someone began to rename the MiG entries in Mikoyan (instead of Mikoyan-Gurevitch). I find it was unaccurate. Do you think MiG is better ? 21:58 Feb 20, 2003 (UTC)That someone was me, Eric, quite some time ago. It was not a careless or casual decision. I gave ample notice of it in the appropriate talk:naming conventions pages (no-one ojected), and I went through and edited all the pages that linked to the pages I renamed. Considered in isolation, I'm not averse to MiG-17 as it's clear and unanbiguous, however all the other Soviet aircraft are in the form Manufacturer Ab-123 and it would be inconsistent to treat MiG and MiG alone differently. The design bureau is \"Mikoyan-Gurevich\" and this is indicated in the \"Mi\" and \"G\" parts of \"MiG\". The most common title of the ''aircraft'' however is plain \"Mikoyan\". The reference I cited above is very careful and accurate. I think it better to stick with that as a guide. Unless there is a good reason suggested not to do so, I'll name them back again. Hey, Eric. It's not worth it. It will just start a flame war and encourage people to put nasty comments on those pages too. Why risk more flame wars and edit wars?  03:21 Feb 21, 2003 (UTC)Eric, please don't make junk articles to prove a point. It's highly unlikely that the article in question will remain. Take a couple of deep breaths. )   03:27 Feb 21, 2003 (UTC)I don't mean to go further this article is anti-semite by the simple fact it exists. 03:31 Feb 21, 2003 (UTC)Eric,I have removed (but not deleted) the C-130 pic from the C-130 Hercules article. The reason is that I arrived at the article from the United States Air Force page and so I assumed (not correctly) that the pic should be a USAF plane. So I changed it. However, I think there are three improvements that might make it worth leaving mine in place  .....- Your pic was rather large. It would probably have made a rather narrow text channel for those who use 800 by 600 resolution (and who use Wikipedia with the options frame visible).- The article is entirely about the USAF Hercules, only a brief mention is made of the other 50 nations who have them.- I provide a thumbnail at 250 pixels wide and a large one at 750 pixels wide.So please can my pic stay? (but I will reinstate yours if you wish)  08:00 Apr 2, 2003 (UTC)You people believe Lir/Vera/Dietary Fiber/Susan/Adam?All I did was clarify this sentence pointed out by Dachshund: “As mentioned, the Soviets bore the heaviest casualties of World War II.  These war causalities can explain much of Russia's behavior after the war.”I added content. I did not delete content. Maybe some user prior do me deleted some content, but who knows. I wasn’t following the rest of the article, just this sentence pointed out by Dachshund.My parents were Holocaust survivors and my entire family apart from the two of them was eradicated. I demand an apology for all you users who believe that slander coming from that lunatic user who has been banned repeatedly. If the charges by this latest reincarnation of Lir have made it onto the mailing list, then I expect you people to correct these charges so that nobody is under the impression that I did this.Hi Eric!I would be very interested to know how you cut my tomcat.f14.250pix.jpg down from my 35K to your 12K. The quality appears to be still OK. Perhaps I could have compressed mine a lot more? I use Photoshop to do my graphics work. Thanks for your help. 20:27 Apr 12, 2003 (UTC)I've edited the picture mainly to remove a little black strip on the left. I use Paint Shop Pro not Photoshop, I simply have used a stronger compression than yours (I tuned it around 25) I  think you can do the same with Photoshop. 20:34 Apr 12, 2003 (UTC)Hi Eric! I ''hate'' to contradict Maury when it comes to engines, but, yes, it is very common to refer to a straight 4 as ''an in-line four''. As an example, I might say: \"The Ford Falcon has an in-line 6, where Holden Commodore has a 3.6 litre V-6.\" I used to read heaps of Australian and British car magazines in my 20s. The term \"in-line\" for a straight 6 (or 4 or 5 - whatever) is common in both Australian and English English. Maybe they don't say it that way in the US. Maybe Maurie made a mistake. Or maybe he knows something that I don't! I think the real answer, though, is that the term can have either meaning depending on context. Technically V and X and H engines are in-line, but you'd usually not use that term for them in general conversation, not unless you wanted to distinguish them from radials or rotaries. One more example, this time using \"in-line\" in the opposite sense: \"Many American fighters used radial engines, but most English fighters, like the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Tempest, used in-line engines.\"Clear as mud?Typical damn English language, isn't it. More words than any other language in the world, and we ''still'' use one word to mean two or three different things! Cheers, Well it's getting a real mess I think that a double radial can be viewed as an inline engine too. Hmmm... I first referred to the Straight engine as an inline (like the French en-ligne) then I moved it Straight. It seems also clear to now that in aviation inline is used for V and flat engine too. So I think we should clarify both senses in the article about inline. 15:04 Apr 13, 2003 (UTC)Hmmm .... I doubt the double radial thing, as the banks of cylinders are usually staggered for better cooling. Somebody made a 4 bank radial once, which had the cylinders in-line, if I remember correctly. But they could never work out how to stop the back cylinder heads warping - they got way too hot. But yes, a sentence or two added to appropriate articles is a good idea. I have never heard anyone say \"straight engine\" before. It is probably an American expression. We always say \"in line engine\" - but ''either'' \"straight 6\" or \"in-line 6\". Go figure.  TThe cylinders doesn't seem staggered on the double Wasp, I'm I wrong, look http://www.aviation-history.com/engines/pr-2800.htm 17:02 Apr 13, 2003 (UTC)As I indicated on Talk:Tintin, find me a source for the accusations of sexism in Tintin (e.g. a magazine article, a book, or a journal article), and I'll be happy to put the paragraph back in. Having read several books and articles about the strip, I haven't come across any such claim, so it smacks of bullshit to me.  Well I think the fact that Tintin was charged for sexism is a fact. Thus this should be discussed. But read my comments  on Talk:Tintin I think many comics before the seventies can be charged of sexism (and to be clear not only comics also advertising, movies, newspapers, politics.... were sexist by today standards, in France a complete equality of right between men and women was only achieved in the late seventies). But you also cuted much more why ?Can you please have a look to The ideology of Tintin this article is mainly based on comment I had wrote on Talk:Tintin IMO it needs a lot work and some others advice to make it NPOV. I'm somewhat reluctant to edit articles on some sensitive subjects because I'm not native-English speaking. 20:17 Apr 14, 2003 (UTC)I've been around for over a year now... but thanks anyway! -) 11:20 Apr 18, 2003 (UTC)Well it's never too late....Thanks for converting the ''Woman Who Did'' image. I've never been good at that sort of thing, and I usually don't look at how big a file is.   17:38 Apr 20, 2003 (UTC)Please do not add NPOV disputes to Wikipedia:Pages needing attention - please instead link them to wikipedia:NPOV dispute. Also, please date (and optionally sign) articles you add to the list.  21:36 May 12, 2003 (UTC)OK 21:41 May 12, 2003 (UTC)Iceland was independent since 1918. I hope you revert the distortion.   13:54 5 Jun 2003 (UTC)\"Iceland remained independent for over 300 years, and was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Limited home rule was granted in 1874, and independence followed in 1918. The Danish king remained the sovereign until 1944, when a republic was founded.\"I must have missed something, there's some contradiction. Why did the UK occupied Iceland just one day after the German occupied Denmark ? Had the Iceland full independance in its foreign policy ? 14:08 5 Jun 2003 (UTC) Sounds reasonable to me. Australia became independant but ''still'' has the Queen of England as the head of state. No-one cares too much. No-one with any brains, anyway. (Disclaimer: I am, in fact, a republican - i.e., I would get rid of the Australian Queen - as, roughly, priority number 9893 on my \"10,000 most important things to do this century\" list.) Is there an ongoing dispute there on Iceland still? If in doubt, ast JTDirl to run his eye over it: he's the expert in this area. Me? I'm OK at duck taxonomy. ) PS Regarding the British invasion. I seem to recall, now that my memory clicks into gear, that there was a complicated bit of political reasoning going on there, but the details escape me. JTD would probably know.The English and the Germans both raced for Narvik (for many reasons, control of Northern Atlantic and over winter-time Iron ore transports maybe the most prominent). The Germans won, but as a side effect the English captured Iceland in the process.   15:08 5 Jun 2003 (UTC)Re: The League of Gentlemen Fripp, et al band - you're right, it couldn't really be called \"early\". But it wasn't between the first and second KC - that ''would'' have been rather early (1970, since KC1 broke in 1969, and KC2 was formed later in 1970).

            "Initialement, la lettre ''ʾalif'' notait une occlusive glottale, ou « coup de glotte », transcrite par [ʔ], ce que confirment les alphabets issus de la même origine phénicienne. Or, il a servi, de la même manière que dans d'autres abjads, avec ''yāʾ'' et ''wāw'', de ''mater lectionis'', c'est-à-dire de caractère de remplacement pour noter une voyelle longue (voir plus bas). De fait, au cours du temps sa valeur phonétique s'est effacée et, depuis, ''ʾalif'' sert principalement à remplacer des phonèmes ou servir de support graphique à certains signes.The Arabic alphabet now mainly uses the ''hamza'' to indicate a glottal stop, which can appear anywhere in a word.  This letter, however, does not function like the others:  elle peut se être écrite seule ou avoir besoin d'un support, in which case it becomes a diacritic: sans support  ء ; avec support  إ ,أ (sur et sous un ''ʾalif''),  ؤ (sur un ''wāw''), ئ (sur un ''yāʾ'' '''sans points'' ou ''yāʾ hamza'').The details of the writing of the ''hamza'' are treated below, following that of the vowels and syllable-division marks, because they are interdependent.

On a souvent dû ajouter ou modifier certaines lettres pour adapter cet alphabet au système phonologique des langues en questions. Certaines langues d'Afrique, comme le haoussa, l'ont aussi utilisé avant de passer à une transcription latine.L'alphabet arabe comprend vingt-neuf lettres fondamentales, et s'écrit de droite à gauche. Il n'y a pas de différence entre les lettres manuscrites et les lettres imprimées ; les notions de lettre capitale et lettre minuscule n'existent pas (l'écriture est donc monocamérale). En revanche, la plupart des lettres s'attachent entre elles, même en imprimerie, et leur graphie diffère selon qu'elles sont précédées et/ou suivies d'autres lettres ou qu'elles sont isolées (on parle de variantes contextuelles). L'alphabet arabe est un ''abjad'', terme technique décrivant les écritures dans lesquels les voyelles ne sont pas implicitement notées ; le lecteur doit donc connaître la langue pour les restituer. Dans les éditions du Coran ou les ouvrages didactiques, cependant, l'on utilise une notation vocalique sous forme de diacritiques. Il existe, de plus, dans les textes vocalisés, une série d'autres diacritiques dont les plus courants sont l'indication de l'absence de voyelle ''(sukūn)'' et la gémination des consonnes ''(šadda)''.L'on fait remonter cet alphabet à l'araméen dans sa variante nabatéenne, lui-même descendant du phénicien (alphabet qui, entre autres, donne naissance à l'alphabet grec et, partant, au cyrillique, aux lettres latines, etc.). La première attestation d'un texte en alphabet arabe remonte à 512 de notre ère. C'est au VIIe siècle que l'on a ajouté des points sur ou sous certaines lettres afin de les différencier, le modèle araméen ayant moins de phonèmes que l'arabe et l'écriture des origines ayant donc dû confondre par une même lettre plusieurs phonèmes.L'alphabet arabe peut être translittéré et transcrit de diverses manières. L'on utilisera de préférence dans ce document la translittération DIN-31635. Il peut être codé par plusieurs jeux de caractères, parmi lesquels ISO-8859-6 et Unicode, grâce au bloc « Arabe », des emplacement U+0600 à U+06FF. Ces deux jeux, cependant, n'indiquent pas pour chaque caractère la forme contextuelle qu'il doit prendre. C'est au moteur de rendu de sélectionner le bon œil. Il existe cependant, dans le cas où l'on voudrait coder une forme particulière d'un caractère, les blocs « Formes de présentation arabe A » (U+FB50 à U+FDFF) et « Formes de présentation arabe B » (U+FE70 à U+FEFF), qui contiennent la majorité des caractères en variante contextuelle ainsi que les caractères étendus propres à d'autres langues. Il est aussi possible d'utiliser les liants sans et avec chasse. Enfin, le codage de l'arabe est logique, c'est-à-dire que l'on entre les caractères à la suite sans se soucier du sens de l'écriture (nécessairement inversé pour un Occidental). C'est encore une fois au moteur de rendu qu'il revient d'afficher les caractères dans le bon sens. À cet égard, si les mots arabes de cette page sont affichés à l'envers, c'est que votre moteur de rendu Unicode n'est pas assez récent.

            "The text below failed the google test, and comes from the first external link. What's the copyright policy of the Croatian government? (The US puts it all the public domain, UK keeps copyright, so we can't just assume that all governments do it the same way.)If we can use this, it still needs a copyedit and wikification.Franjo Tudjman is the first president of the independent and democratic Croatian state and the supreme commander of its armed forces. As head of state, he was the initiator of the organisation of the defence and the creation of the Croatian army, and the chief political and military strategist in the establishment of a sovereign Croatia and its international recognition, and defence and victory in the Homeland War. He became the first president of the Republic of Croatia after the first multiparty elections in 1990.Franjo Tudjman was born in Veliko Trgovisce, in the northern Croatian region of Zagorje, on 14 May 1922. He attended elementary school in his birthplace, and secondary school in Zagreb from 1934 to 1941. He graduated from a senior military academy in Belgrade in 1957, and earned a doctor's degree in political sciences at the University of Zagreb in 1965.During secondary school, Tudjman was part of a national democratic movement, for which he was imprisoned in 1940. He was a member of the anti-fascist movement since 1941. After the Second World War, he was employed at the Ministry of National Defence's Personnel Service, and Main Staff of the Yugoslav People's Army between 1945 and 1961. Despite being promoted to the rank of general in 1960, Tudjman left active military service in 1961, and in Zagreb he established the Institute for the History of the Labour Movement in Croatia, staying in the manager's office until 1967.As senior lecturer Tudjman taught \"Socialist Revolution and Contemporary National History of Croatia\" at the Faculty ofPolitical Sciences in Zagreb until 1967. He was a representative in the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Croatia from 1965 to 1969, sub-editor and assistant editor-in-chief for the Military Encyclopaedia, sub-editor for the Lexicography InstituteEncyclopaedia, member of the editor's office at \"Vojno Delo\" magazine, editor-in-chief at \"Putevi Revolucije\" magazine, member of the board of directors at the cultural association Matica Hrvatska, and president of the Matica Hrvatska Commission for Croatian History since 1970. Tudjman has been a member of the Association of Croatian Writers since 1970 and of the Croatian PEN Centre since 1987. He has been a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts since December 1992.Tudjman was imprisoned after the suppression of the \"Croatian Spring\" democracy movement in 1971. The communist authorities labelled him the chief culprit for allegedly suspicious connections with foreign factors and Croatian emigrants. Thanks to the intervention of Croatian writer Miroslav Krleza with Josip Broz Tito, Tudjman escaped long-term imprisonment. In 1972, he was sentenced to two years in prison. The sentence was subsequently reduced to nine months.Tudjman was sentenced again in February 1981 to three years in prison, and prohibited from public activity for five years on account of an interviews given to Swedish and German televisions and the French radio, in which he voiced his  opinions on history and advocated pluralist democracy.He was imprisoned in Lepoglava between January 1982 and February 1983, when he was released for medical treatment. He was returned to prison in May 1984, but was paroled in September due to a deteriorating health condition.In 1987, when he was restituted his passport after 17 years, Tudjman travelled abroad, first to Canada and the United States of America, and then to European countries. He gave lectures to Croatian emigrants, promoting the notion of an all-round Croat reconciliation and advocating the creation of a Croatian state.In 1989, Tudjman established the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) political party, and became its president. Through the HDZ, he formulated a national political programme which led to the national and political mobilisation of the Croat people in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the emigration. This was the basis for national reconciliation and a strong resistance to the increasingly violent assaults of Serb chauvinism and encroachment on Croatian territories. Tudjman and the HDZ won the first free multiparty elections in 1990; he was elected President of the Republic, and formed the first democratic Croatian government. At presidential elections in 1992 and 1997, the Croatian people re-elected him President of the Republic to five-year terms.Due to the growing pressure of Serbian hegemonism and Yugoslav centralism after the first multiparty elections, Tudjmanaccelerated his activities on organising the state and securing its international recognition. Referring to the historical and cultural identity of the Croatian people, he encountered special understanding and continual support of Pope John Paul II.At the time of Yugoslavia's disintegration, Tudjman conducted a policy of negotiations on the state's confederal organisation or the peaceful split-up of its republics. Tudjman used the policy, which in Croatia also encountered disapproval, to lessen the intensity of the imminent aggression by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). When the aggression on Croatia started,  he countered it also through international negotiations and an increasingly organised armed force.After the declaration of Croatia's independence in 1991 and the beginning of open aggression by Serbia and the JNA, it was Tudjman's policy, balancing between Croatia's potential and unfavourable international circumstances, that stopped the Serbian military offensive on Croatian territory and countered international factors which were extremely unfavourably disposed toward Croatia's independence.Following the declaration of Croatia's independence, Tudjman skilfully avoided  traps in diplomatic games around Croatia and by 1995 he organised the army and  police forces to the extent which enabled the country to on its own liberate the largest part of its territory in operations \"Flash\" (May 1995) and \"Storm\" (August 1995).The strength of the Croatian Army enabled the peaceful reintegration of the Croatian Danube River region in January 1998, completing the process of establishing sovereignty on the whole of Croatia's territory recognised by international law, under Tudjman's leadership.In regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tudjman conducted a policy which was aimed at protecting the interests of the Croat people.Relations between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina went through different phases under complex internal and international circumstances. Eventually, the victories of the Croatian Army and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) following the liberation of Croatia and a large part of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Serb aggressor led to the signing of the peace agreement and the establishment of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This created a foundation for securing an equal constitutional and legal position of the Croat people in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Franjo Tudjman, a Croatian officer, historian and statesman, has written  numerous books and papers (treatises) on topics from the fields of military doctrine, history, political science and the philosophy of history. His most important works are: Rat protiv rata (War Against War), Zagreb, 1957; Stvaranje socijalisticke Jugoslavije (The Establishment of the Socialist Yugoslavia), Zagreb, 1960; Okupacija i revolucija (Occupation and Revolution), Zagreb, 1963; Velike ideje i mali narodi (Great Ideas and Small Nations), Zagreb, 1969; Nacionalno pitanje u suvremenoj Evropi (The National Issue In Modern Europe), Munich-Bacelona, 1981; Dr?avnost nacija - kljuc mira Europe (The Statehood of Nations - The Key to Peace in Europe), Lidingo, 1982; O povijesti rje?avanja hrvatskog pitanja i samoodredenja naroda u svijetu (On the History of Resolving the Croatian Issue and the Self-Determination of World Nations), Toronto, 1987; Stjepan Radic u hrvatskoj povijesti (The Role of Stjepan Radic in Croatian History), Sudbury (Canada), 1988;  Bespuca povijesne zbiljnosti.

He died during the night between December 10 and 11, 1999 at the age of 77. Following the death of President Tudjman, presidential elections are won by Stjepan Mesic.\n",

            "PS: Here's a bibliography entry I just saw for a recent journal article on the Amenhotep-III/Akhenaten co-regency length issue, arguing for a lengthy co-regency: MARTÍN VALENTÍN, Francisco J., Indicaciones y evidencias de una corregencia entre Amenhotep III y Amenhotep IV en la necrópolis tebana, Boletín de la Asociación Española de Egiptología, Madrid 6 (1996), 119-146. Four Theban tombs display a number of common characteristics which strongly support the theory of a coregency between Amenhotep III and Akhnaton. The tombs are TT 48 (Amenemhat), TT 55 (Ramose), TT 57 (Khaemhat), and TT 192 (Kheruef). The similarities can be summarized as follows: a) relief technique; b) theme (the audience scene of Amenhotep III’s year 30); c) three tombs belong to persons related to the king; d) all tombs show signs of a damnatio memoriae; e) all owners participated in the ceremonies of year 30; f) all tombs were constructed and decorated by the same individual (probably Sa-Mut); g) in at least three tombs both sovereigns are depicted. The coregency would have begun in year 28 and lasted until year 38/39. The tombs were therefore constructed in Amenhotep IV's \"Theban\" period and the owners seem to have fallen in disgrace in either the years 30/31 or year 37.\n",

            "Hello, Frank.I've always wondered:Do you ''try'' to write in such a way that it will be difficult for most people to understand you?This certainly has its purposes (and I've always found you interesting, at least to a degree), but I don't think that it belongs in Wikipedia. As to: ''I've always wondered: Do you \"try\" [...]'' I've rarely wondered whether an encyclopedia might benefit those who readily try not to understand as much as those who readily try to imagine being understood. I've never wondered that before, since it's not the sort of thing that one would normally compare. I'd say that an encyclopædia is ''most'' useful when: The reader tries their best to understand; The writer assumes that the reader isn't going to try very hard. That is, as writers, we should try to be comprehensible with a ''minimum'' of effort on the reader's part, just in case.As to: ''I've always found you interesting [...'' Regrettably (and I may not even begin to comprehend the magnitude of my loss) I can't recall having found you instructive. I'll take it as a compliment that you seem to imply that this ''is'' a great loss  I only know that ''some'' people have found me instructive (on USENET I mean, where we met). In any case, I try to be easily understood (even though I don't always succeed), since that helps in being instructive. And I'm not going to come out and say that you ''do'' try to be hard to understand  still, I wonder.   20:03 Jan 11, 2003 (UTC) Regards, , Jan. 9th, 20:35 (PST).What does \"Hunmin jeong'eum haerye\" have to do with this? Are you being serious, or are you trying to irritate me (and other members of this project)? You give the impression of willfully misinterpreting what other people say. And please don't create self-links: \"Jerry Seinfeld in ''Seinfeld''\" on the Seinfeld page itself.   19:32 Jan 6, 2003 (UTC)As to: ''please don't create self-links: \"Jerry Seinfeld in Seinfeld\" on the Seinfeld page itself'' How ougth We to distinguish, or even to emphasize, '''that''' the linked entity referred to \"Jerry Seinfeld in Seinfeld\", '''not''' to \"Jerry Seinfeld in Wikipedia\"? Specificly, Seinfeld: ''[...] features clips [...] of Seinfeld delivering a standup routine'' Is it reproducible that the reference is strictly to \"Jerry Seinfeld, the character appearing and scripted in Seinfeld\", or not possibly instead to \"Jerry Seinfeld, the overarching comedian which may have drawn on the whole of in Wikipedia\"? In the latter case, at least as an POV, ought We not give this particular instance the recognition of providing a link Seinfeld?As to: ''What does \"Hunmin jeong'eum haerye\" have to do with this?'' In My view, the '''making''' of the '''article''' by that name provides an instance of ''Make \"Wiki\" explain''. Thereby it appears to illustrate its ''meaning'', about which You had asked. Also, that was the first article to appear when I searched ''Explanation''.As to: ''You give the impression of willfully misinterpreting what other people say'' Far be it from me. I wish to impress by carefully interpreting what '''''wikipedians''''' write, and, to the best of my ability and resources, ask Us about may not have understood right away; allowing all to do equally well. Best regards, ,Jan. 6, 12:28 PST.No, it wasn't a joke. Your use of the verb \"instructs\" is, frankly, bizarre. I don't understand any of your response below. Your excessive linking and quoting makes things very hard to follow. What does \" Make '''''Wiki''''' explain.\" mean? -  13:31 Jan 6, 2003 (UTC)As to ''Your use of the verb \"instructs\" is, frankly, bizarre.'' (Instance of my use of ''instructs , acting as verb'' may be found on this page and in refeences therein.) I'm sorry that my use of ''instructs , acting as verb'' can be characterized as ''frankly, bizarre''; especially since I'm under the impression that ''instruction , acting as noun'' which appears in Encyclopedia ought to be commensurate. Can You provide instances of whether and how We have or ought to observe ''instructs , acting as verb'' instead, please? Otherwise your characterization would appear, frankly, bizarre.As to ''What does \" Make Wiki explain.\" mean?'' Excellent, a question. (Also, therefore, as in ''Excellent question''). What appears be an adequately good (''at least'') answer is viewed as in Hunmin jeong'eum haerye. (Also, therefore, my reply may ''Itself'' be addressing Your question.)As to ''Your excessive linking and quoting makes things very hard to follow.'' I appreciate Your afforts to follow nevertheless. Having attempted to do so myself, I found that the link given below might more easily be expressed as ''2 as denoting Two''.As to ''No, it wasn't a joke.'' Of course '''that's''' always understood, is it not?! Best regards, ,Jan. 6, 10:58 PST.Are you using translation software to write here? You keep using phrases like \"a neighbourhood, which instruct Physics as well as Mathematics?\"  this usage of the verb \"instructs\" is unusual. As you can see, several wikipedians are having problems understanding what you write, both in articles and talk pages.   10:28 Jan 6, 2003 (UTC)As to: ''You keep using phrases like \"a neighbourhood, which instruct Physics as well as Mathematics?\"  this usage of the verb \"instructs\" is unusual.'' I don't ''know'' if that was meant to be a joke (if so, noting the apparent unusual use of \"a neighbourhood\" ought to be about twice as funny), if you're deliberately refusing to resolve ''articles [...] which instruct Physics as well as Mathematics''and ''articles, e.g. about what is and what isn't a neighbourhood'' (which I seem to have expressed recently in Talk:Local coordinate system) or if you're plainly not understanding me, in which case I count on being able to Write in '''''Wiki''''', and (thereby) Make '''''Wiki''''' explain. anyways. Each of these options involves as much as the notion of ''2'', which is apparently already articulated ...As to ''As you can see, several wikipedians are having problems understanding what you write, both in articles and talk pages'' Indeed. Fortunately, Wikipedia instructs even them to be considerate and even rational in addressing such problems; since first and foremost they're Ours. Best regards, ,Jan. 6, 5:18 PST.You've got me really confused, Fwappler.  What language are you speaking?  As to ''What language are you speaking?'' I don't speak language a lot; instead express what I thought in writing   usually Aleutian Denglisch.As to ''You've got me really confused'' I beg your pardon. What's Your question?Best regards,   ,Jan. 5, 22:53 PST.Interesting rearranging you've done here. I'm not sure if I'm writing in the right place. I get the impression that you don't understand what the Wikipedia project is about and what it is trying to achieve. Your use of English makes much of what you write here hard to understand. You should go see Talk:Duration   21:27 Jan 5, 2003 (UTC) Sorry, I noticed your statement only as of this writing. Hopefully my renewed rearrangement of correspondence indicates that you ```did''' apparently ''the right place''; at the when I ought to have replied, I just seem not to have gotten past  follow-up; sorry. And the principle about how to be ''writing in the right place'' on this page still remains.As to ''You should go see Talk:Duration'' I had already replied to your kind notification from earlier the same day., Jan. 9th, 19:38 (PST).Regarding Chart, see what AxelBoldt wrote on Talk:Local coordinate system. You write above: \"As to ''PLEASE stop writing everything''\"  I don't if that was meant to be a joke, if you're misunderstanding me, or if you're deliberately taking my remarks out of context.   14:46 Jan 5, 2003 (UTC)As to ''As to PLEASE stop writing everything[...]\"  I don't [know] if that was meant to be a joke, if you're misunderstanding me, or if you're deliberately taking my remarks out of context.'' Yes, ''and'' No, . As to ''stop writing [... in { }]'' First of all I've valued your instruction(s), seeing my use of ''Talk:Markup'' being so directed until further notice; and ''I presume'' having thereby ''Your PLEA'' adequately ''Squelched''. However, As to ''writing everything'' I couldn't help but observe and focus on the superlative presumption of your request; and, while I had to go to sleep, I attempted to gather instructions on whether and how there's ''no I in Wikipedia'', phonemically or otherwise. Distributed instruction, '''you know''' ? May We not observe wholes by recognizing their parts, say: '''find out''' !?As to ''see what AxelBoldt wrote on Talk:Local coordinate system'' How do We reconcile the presumption of a reader being one intelligible Wikipedian, albeit ever so ignorant of the subject, with said reader's selfproclaimed ignorance on ''what a commensurate relation is'' to start with ?! - Do We lead by example?! ,   Jan. 5, 13:05 PST.Fwappler, PLEASE stop writing everything in { }. They have no special meaning in wiki markup & make everything you write in talk pages hard to read.   13:54 Jan 5, 2003 (UTC)As to ''{ } ... have no special meaning in wiki markup'' In my view, that's a terrible waste, or a terrific resource, of bandwidth. But strangely, even though Wikipedia knows about at least about Markup, Bandwidth and Resource Wikipedia itself doesn't seem to be too excited about this circumstance yet.As to ''make everything you write in talk pages hard to read'' That's quite contrary to my intention, which is for my writing to be instructive; especially for ... (you know who? ;).As to ''PLEASE stop writing everything'' Well, I hope I've written already enough to catch on (with those who '''are''' excited about wiki markup; please bear with me. Otherwise, of NECESSITY: I myself don't have the endurance to be writing always in any event. Best regards,  ,      Jan. 5, 2003 p.s. My view of Chart has meanwhile disappeared, and with it the instruction I meant to convey in Talk:Duration; I may require it there explicitly.Frank, are you deliberately inserting nonsense into Wikipedia? If so, please stop doing it. See Talk:Pluralis Majestatis; also, \"Ümmerläuterern\" is not a word.  12:24 Jan 5, 2003 (UTC)As to ''deliberately inserting nonsense'' In my view not at all; especially since  does have instructions concerning ''nonsense''. However, I admit being challanged by the present absence of instructions concerning Allusions; and even more so by the apparent presumption to distinguish the notion of  as an encyclopedia as a whole, as reinforced by its potentially stupifyingly marvelous , from the notion of  as apparetly only weakly  and lonesome entities.As to \"Ümmerläuterern\" that's a German \"Wortschöpfung\"  (well, as I just found out,  knows this one already as neologism ... Super!)  which alludes to Pluralis Majestatis by the bag-full. Btw.,  first observed it in Talk:Bundesland, in a discussion devoted to different forms of plural.Wikipedia ist nicht der Ort für Wortschöpfungen. Wenn Du Deiner Kreativität freien Lauf lassen möchtest, empfehle ich de.talk.bizarre.  Best regards,  ,      Jan. 5, 2003 p.s. In my view, all my |writing takes far too long; I may have to ask for some technical relief from  ...As to ''Memo to self'' observed in Talk:Duration having been observed by '' 23:10 Jan 4, 2003 (UTC)''. Actually, that's not even wrong, since Distinct||. ''Damn  We're smooth! ...''Hello there Fwappler, welcome to the 'pedia! I hope you like the place and decide to stay.

            "Remember the template system I told you about? I'm now working on the syntax details. What do you think of the following syntax for transcluding templates:|Country table|Name=>Germany|Population => 80 million|Flag => Germany-Flag.png|Anthem =>||Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit|für das deutsche Vaterland...|____Explanations:The template is defined as a block whose every line starts with an \"|\", and whose last line ends with \"|__\" (or any number of underscores greater than two).The first line defines the page from the Template: namespace that will be transcluded as a template, with the keys/values substituted accordingly.Keys/values are separated with the \"=>\" sequence (single spaces before and after the sequence are trimmed).Values can be multi-line.If there is only one key to pass, it might be useful to do a call by value without any name:|Image,left|Stars.jpg|__Reasoning:I thought about using a HTML syntax, but I wanted something that is quick, not too confusing and which lets the template stand out from the normal wikisource. The syntax proposed above should accomplish this; the only downside might be the need to type \"|\" before every line (but then again, templates probably shouldn't be used for very large texts anyway).I have to say that I really liked the thought of using : because it is just so damn easy to type ([SHIFT], press right pinky finger; what could be easier than that?). I always have a hard time reaching the | character without looking (same for the underscore character). IMO, :, is more wiki. Also to separate subheads from data, how about this;Template:Country::Name::GermanyPopulation::80 millionFlag::Germany-Flag.pngAnthem::Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit für das deutsche/Template:Country::mavI'm not sure how valid any keyboard layout based arguments are, given the vast differences in these layouts across countries. The | is usually a bit harder to reach than more common characters, though. My problem with the double-colons is that they're really hard on the eyes  they look like bird droppings and they do not stand out from regular text. I'm afraid this will lead to readability problems when used with text that has colons in it. Some templates might make the table cell names themselves values that can be changed, so you would end up with something likeCaption:Size of Wikipedia:Field:Size:The | may be harder to type, but that's the only way to get its advantage  a relatively unusual character that stands out, and which is also a good separator because pairs of it form a straight line. That's my rationale at least. Hmhmhm.It's not that big of a deal since both the : and the | are ''much'' better than HTML. I'm more concerned with results than process. mav\n",

There is no overt indication of permission being obtained. On the other hand, I imagine that the owner of the material is the Botanical Garden, and they are probably happy with the publicity.

Produits tensoriels topologiques et espaces nucléaires.2.    Dualité \"continue\" et \"discrète\" (catégories dérivées, \"six opérations\").3.    Yoga Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck (K-théorie, relation à la théorie des intersections).4     Schémas.5.    Topos.6.    Cohomologie étale et l-adique.7.    Motifs et groupe de Galois motivique (ƒ [à revoir]-catégories de Grothendieck).8.    Cristaux et cohomologie cristalline, yoga \"coefficients de De Rham\", \"coefficient de Hodge”.9.    \"Algèbre topologique\" ∞-champs, dérivateurs ; formalisme cohomologique des topos, comme inspiration pour une nouvelle algèbre homotopique.10. Topologie modérée.11. Yoga de géométrie algébrique anabélienne, théorie de Galois-Teichmüller.12. Point de vue \"schématique\" ou \"arithmétique\" pour les polyèdres réguliers et les configurations régulières en tous genres.Mis à part le premier de ces thèmes, dont un volet important fait partie de ma thèse (1953) et a été développé dans ma période d'analyse fonctionnelle entre 1950 et 1955, les onze autres se sont dégagés au cours de ma période de géomètre, à partir de 1955.[2] Parmi ces thèmes, le plus v a s t e par sa p o r t é e me parait être celui des t o p o s, qui fournit l'idée d'une synthèse de la géométrie algébrique, de la topologie et de l'arithmétique. Le plus vaste par 1’ é t e n d u e  d e s  d é v e 1 o p p e m e n t s auxquels il a donné lieu dès à présent, est le thème des s c h é m a s. (Voir à ce sujet la note de b. de p. (*) page 20 C'est lui qui fournit le cadre \"par excellence\" de huit autres parmi les thèmes envisagés (savoir, tous les autres à l'exclusion des thèmes 1, 5 et 10), en même temps qu'il fournit la notion centrale pour un renouvellement de fond en comble de la géométrie algébrique, et du langage algébrico-géométrique.Au bout opposé, le premier et le dernier des douze thèmes m'apparaissent comme étant de dimensions plus modestes que les autres. Pourtant, pour ce qui est du dernier, introduisant une optique nouvelle dans le thème fort ancien des polyèdres réguliers et des configurations régulières, je doute que la vie d'un mathématicien qui s'y consacrerait corps et âme suffise à l'épuiser. Quant au premier de tous ces thèmes, celui des produits tensoriels topologiques, il a joué plus le rô1e d'un [P 22] nouvel outil prêt à l'emploi, que celui d'une source d'inspiration pour des développements ultérieurs. Cela n'empêche qu'il m'arrive encore, jusqu'en ces dernières années, de recevoir des échos sporadiques de travaux plus ou moins récents, résolvant (vingt ou trente ans après) certaines des questions que j'avais laissées en suspens.Les plus profonds (à mes yeux) parmi ces douze thèmes, sont celui des motifs , et celui étroitement lié de géométrie algébrique anabélienne et du yogad e     Galois-Teichmüller.Du point de vue de la p u i s s a n c e   d’ o u t i 1 s parfaitement au point et rodés par mes soins, et d'usage courant dans divers \"secteurs de pointe\" dans la recherche au cours des deux dernières décennies, ce sont les volets “s c h é m a s” et “c o h o m o 1 o g i e      é t a 1 e e t l- a d i q u e” qui me paraissent les plus notables. Pour un mathématicien bien informé, je pense que dès à présent il ne peut guère y avoir de doute que l'outil schématique, comme celui de la cohomologie l-adique qui en est issu, font partie des quelques grands acquis du siècle, venus nourrir et renouveller notre science au cours de ces dernières générations.It's clearly written here what are the main points. And 'topological vector spaces' are explicitely written here to be of the least importance (with 'point de vue schématique') among others.So we translate it into English and put in the article. I suggest putting it before saying any POV words like algebraic geometry, homological algebra and functional analysis. And I think he author's word about himself is more NPOV than everything ''we'' can say.\n",

Es wurde als ''Magna Germania'' zwischen Oder und Weichsel beschrieben. Teile Schlesiens wurden von Kaiser Arnulf von Kärnten dem mährischen Herrscher als Lehen gegeben.Im Jahre 963 wurde das Land zwischen Oder und Netze von Kaiser Otto I. als Reichslehen an Mieszko I., den später so genannten Piastenreich (Geschichte Polens) gegeben. Es wurde unter Herzog Kasimir I. wieder selbständig. Der Stamm der Silinger (s.o.) gab dem Land den Namen ''Silesia'', Schlesia. Weitere deutsche Besiedelung erfolgte im späten Mittelalter. Es entstanden wichtige Städte wie z.B. Breslau. Der südöstliche Teil um die Städte Oppeln und Kattowitz heißt '''Oberschlesien''', er hatte im Unterschied zu '''Niederschlesien''' bereits vor 1945 eine deutsch/polnisch sprechende Mischbevölkerung.Im 16. Jahrhundert wurden Staatsverträge zwischen Schlesien und Brandenburg-Preußen abgeschlossen, wobei Schlesien beim Aussterben der schlesischen Piasten an Brandenburg-Preußen fallen sollte. Die Habsburger HRR Kaiser brachten Schlesien aber in Habsburger Besitz, als 1569 der letzte schlesische Piast starb. Nach dem preußisch-österreichischen Krieg zwischen Friedrich II. und Kaiserin Maria Theresia wurde der größte Teil Schlesiens 1742/44 preußisch, ein kleinerer Teil um Troppau (heute Opava in Tschechien) blieb österreichisch.Nach dem Wiener Kongress 1815 wurde Schlesien eine der zunächst 10 Provinzen des Staates Preußen, wobei Teile der bisher sächsischen Oberlausitz der neuen Provinz eingegliedert wurden. Provinzhauptstadt wurde Breslau.Mit der beginnenden Industrialisierung wurde '''Oberschlesien''' mit seinen Steinkohlebergwerken zu einer wirtschaftlich wichtigen Region.Nach Ende des 1. Weltkriegs kamen Teile '''Oberschlesien'''s an Polen, obwohl vorher der Ausgang einer Volksbefragung für den Verbleib bei Deutschland war. Die verbliebene Provinz wurde 1919 in zwei Provinzen aufgeteilt, Oberschlesien mit der Hauptstadt Oppeln und Niederschlesien mit der Hauptstadt Breslau. Österreichisch-Schlesien kam nach dem ersten Weltkrieg zur Tschechoslowakei und gehört heute zu Tschechien. 1938 wurden beide Provinzen wieder vereinigt und 1941 erneut geteilt.Nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg wurde ganz Schlesien von der Sowjetunion erobert und erhielt polnische Administration, bis auf ein kleines Gebiet um die Stadt Görlitz.In den Jahren 1945/46 fand eine gewaltsame Vertreibung der deutschen Bevölkerung statt. Lediglich in Oberschlesien verblieb eine kleine Minderheit. Statt dessen wurden Menschen angesiedelt, die von Stalin aus ehemals ostpolnischen Gebieten gewaltsam umgesiedelt wurden. \n",

            "Because of its rich history Silesia has produced a unique cultural mix based on the local Silesian tradition with heavy Polish, Czech and German influences. For most of its history Silesia was an object of conflict between Bohemia, Poland, Roman Empire, Austria, Prussia and Germany. Today the region is inhabited by the Poles, Silesians, Germans, Czechs and Moravians.History of Silesia is very often written from Polish, German or Czech (Bohemian) point of view and very rarely from Silesian point of view.

Surely not that of the Silesians organized here: http://www.bund-der-vertriebenen.de and here: Landsmannschaft Schlesien: www.schlesien-lm.de, www.schlesien-bonn.de/  etc. etc. By the way, you cannot expect non-Poles to read Polish. There are many inhabitants of Silesia who say: \"We are not Poles, we are not Germans, we are the Silesians\". In think that the most important organizations today is Ruch Autonomii Slaska (RAS, Silesian Autonomy Movement) http://www.slonsk.de/Slonsk/Catn/CzymJestRAS.htm http://www.slonsk.de/Yes I can expect non-Poles to read Polish. I have many friends from Denmark, Belgium, Ireland, Ukraine, Norway, Iraq who are fluent Polish speakers.  Polish friends from Denmark, maybe? Understand: German is an international language just like French, English and maybe Spanish. Most Poles with some education speak German, but very few Germans speak Polish, just like very few Englishmen speak Danish.  Few Germans speak Polish?? That's prsisely the problem. Polish historians usually learn German to study the sources and to read books written by their German friends to understand the history fully, and to learn about the various points of view. On the other hand German historians very seldom learn Polish and are very happy with what they read in German. I hope it will change in future. ;-) I agree that English, French and Spanish are international languages, German used to be, but it is not now. Im my opinion you overestimate the importance of German in Poland. English is widely learned and spoken in Poland these days, German is known only to some specialists. If I was asked for a ranking of popularity of foreign languages in Poland: English, French, Russian, German, Spanish, Italian.

            "My name is Eduardo Pellew Wilson.  I was born in Brazil and am a Brazilian citizen.  My paternal ancestral line, however, is British as I will show below.  I should like to discuss the notion of JUS SANGUINIS, which means that a paternal line will bear a specific family name forever.  In addition, how can it be explained that, although living outside Britain, we, who are of British descent, still speak English, remember our ancestors and British traditions and, what is more significant, we pass on all our family history to our children!  Lex sanguinis is all about that and cannot become so weak, to the point of making Lex soli so powerful and it is today.  These are two very distinct laws and change one's whole conception of the world, from a cultural standpoint.Let me show my paternal ancestral line:1. Alexander Wilson (1774-1817), head of the family; British subject, 1st Lieutenant Royal Marines and secretary to Lord Exmouth; married Portsoy, Scotland, 1799, Jean Gray (1775-1847) (Pedigree of Bean of Portsoy, circa 1895, mentioned in Scottish Family Histories, by Ms Ferguson, 1986) and had:2. Edward Pellew Wilson (1803-1887), head of the family; born Portsoy,British subject, merchant, shipowner, etc., knight of the Imperial Order of the Rose, of the Brazilian Empire, by decree 1866; married Salvador City, Bahia, Brazil, 1830, Maria Constança da Silva Freire (1815-1877), of a Portuguese family, and had:3. Edward Pellew Wilson Junior (1832-1899), head of the family; born Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, British subject and Brazilian citizen, created Count de Wilson in the Portuguese nobility by decree 08-10-1891 (N.B. He was an important member of the British community in Brazil); engineer, shipowner, banker, landowner, honorary consul of Italy in Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro, knight, commander, officer, etc.; married Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, 1856, Felisbella Ernestina Cintra da Silva (1840-1912), Countess de Wilson by marriage, and had:4. Edward Pellew Wilson (1858-1934), head of the family; born Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil; British subject and Brazilian citizen; shipowner, merchant, banker, commander, etc.; married Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1890, Georgeanna de Sá (1866-1935) and had:5. Eduardo Wilson Junior (1892-1955), head of the family; born Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; British subject and Brazilian citizen; lawyer and federal civil servant (federal inspector of the Revenue); married Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1923, Maria Borges Monteiro (1892-1959) and had:6. Eduardo Wilson Neto (1932-1998), head of the family; born Rio de Janeiro City; Brazilian citizen; lawyer and state civil servant (attorney of the Rio de Janeiro State); married Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, 1963, Zilda Catarina Sica (1931-2002) and had:7. Eduardo Pellew Wilson (1964-    ), head of the family; born Niterói, Rio de Janeiro; Brazilian citizen; Ba Philosophy, post-graduation course on International Relations, Ba Law; poliglot (including English), translator (including English), knight of the Order of Malta (Malta), of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem (the Holy See) and Saints Mauritius and Lazarus (of the House of Savoy), Count de Wilson by authorisation of the Nobility Council of Portugal (2002), member of the board of directors of the Brasília and Northern Brazil Association of the Knights of the Order of Malta, etc.; married Rio de Janeiro City, 1995, Maria Augusta de Araujo Jobim.As head of my Wilson family I have been passed on the history of my family, which is BRITISH from my paternal ancestral line.  If Lex sanguinis is supposed to work, for it shows values from generations and generations, apart from any noble blood which I have, I find it only natural that I should be able to acquire the British citizenship, even if my father was not a British citizen, as can be seen above.  Lex sanguinis cannot and does not exclude those who did not look for a nationality by descent, IF HE OR SHE DID NOT DENY THEIR RIGHT TO NATIONALITY BY DESCENT.  This the case in my family.  No ancestor of mine never denied his British citizenship, much on the contrary.  If I cannot be a British citizen today, as was explained at the Consulate General of Rio de Janeiro by means of a letter a few years ago, just because my father was not a British citizen, then Lex sanguinis is not so sanguinis as such word makes us think and a whole neurosis connected to being forbidden from becoming a British citizen will invariably be developed in my mind.  I have written this because I should like everyone to read it and think how can a family cultivate their history without being supported legally?I remember that when the Prime MInister Tony Blair came to São Paulo in 2001 for not only an official visit to this country but also a visit to the British community in Brazil, which, it should be noted, has never been a British colony, I lent my family portraits to be photographed and the history of my family to be a little told at the exhibition held at Cultura Inglesa in São Paulo.  This is not only about the PAST!  I am here, I am alive and I live in the PRESENT, with my family history behing me.Next October a Meeting of British Communities for Latin America and Mexico will take place in Punta del Leste, Uruguay, and I was invited to participate.  I would very much like to participate in it as a British citizen.  I want to acquire the British citizenship and that is why I am writing these line to you.My e-mail is eduardopellew@yahoo.co.uk and if you can help me I should be deeply grateful.Thank you all.Eduardo Pellew Wilson, Count de Wilson.sssss\n",

            "The soft sciences such as sociology and psychology include many researchers who use mathematics and use statistics, so you have not yet shown that your notion of science includes knowledge-methods of which some totally reject any overt use of maths.Would you include literature (Moliere, Shakespeare, Zola, Proust), the bits of political sciences which are math-free, installation art? Are these sciences? They make hypotheses about the world, they experiment with it, they find that some experiments work, some don't, they evaluate their experiments.In my experience, people in rich, English-speaking countries would tend to exclude these from ''science'', largely because of the lack of maths.i'm not trying to be ''post-modern'' here, and i'm a bit uncomfortable with arguing for a sharp anglo vs euro division, but in my experience, there is a real spectrum of how the word ''science'' is used. Personally (and i admit i'm a  scientist who works with simple mathematics ;), i prefer to think that the bits of sociology and psychology which do not have enough maths to disambiguate their hypotheses, experiments, evaluation etc are not science, while other bits do qualify as science. It's also true that in this point of view (i'm certainly not alone), use of maths is necessary, though not sufficient. Bad use of maths (and especially statistics) leads to poor science.Back to the cultural bit, since it's not just my opinion alone which is relevant: maybe another way of putting it is that in some cultures there's simply no sharp division between arts and sciences.Here's a department of the CNRS (Centre national de recherche scientifique) in France, showing its subject areas (sections):http://www.cnrs.fr/SHS/departement/sections.php''section 31  Hommes et milieux  ?volution, interactions    section 32  Mondes anciens et m?di?vaux    section 33  Formation du monde moderne    section 34  Repr?sentations, langages - Communication    section 35  Pens?e philosophique - Sciences des textes - Cr?ation artistique, scientifique et technique    section 36  Sociologie - Normes et r?gles    section 37  Economie et soci?t?    section 38  Unit? de l'homme et diversit? des cultures    section 39  Espaces, territoires et soci?t?s    section 40  Politique, pouvoir, organisation''More or less: society, ancient history, medieval history, modern history, human languages, philosophy, artistic creation, human unity and diversity; space, territories and societies; politics, power and organisation.i guess these mostly fall under ''soft sciences'' in English, but many people insist that they are simply ''not sciences''. Rather than having endless arguments, describing the source of the dispute seems to me the wikipedia way to go.Anyway, i'm not that keen to do a language search to trace the use of the word ''science'', so please have a look to see if my correction is sufficiently NPOV (wait a few minutes)...   14:01 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)\n",

I am not going to get into a pov argument about which story is most famous.  Good. don't then. stop damaging the Asimov article   17:41 Jan 17, 2003 (UTC)''I'' get us mixed up too, Tarquin! When I first signed up I had already noticed your handle and felt that it was a little rude of me to chose one so similar, but I've been \"Tannin\" in a lot of places for quite a few years now, and don't have much imagination, so I just shrugged and went ahead anyway. Sorry for any confusion. (And just as well that you and I don't seem to get into conflicts much - I should imagine that the thought of following ''Recent Changes'' through an edit war between \"Tannin\" and \"Tarquin\" is not one that many readers would relish.) Like that newscast I saw once describing a meeting between Ronald Reagan and Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan.... Yeesh.   Dare I mention the famous sporting occasion on which Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee was batting and got out caught? On the opposing side was English fast bowler Dillie, and spin bowler Willey (I forget their first names). The result on the scorecard had a certain inevitability about it: ''Lille, caught Willey, bowled Dillee.'' Still more famous was the time when that same English spin bowler was batting against the West Indies, with their fearsome pace attack led by Michael Holding. Some poor unfortunate radio commentator uttered the immortal words: \"It's 6 for 214 as play resumes; the bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey\". (Sorry, I'm messing up your talk page. Read, laugh if it takes you that way, then revert me out of here.) Or the fellow drowsing in a Karachi hotel near a stadium, hearing the scores announced in a field hockey game, Singh, Singh, Singh, Singh, thinking Singh must be a heck of a player, then finding that all players on both sides were named Singh.    Hey, wait a minute, how do we know you aren't both the same person? I didn't find the similarity rude  amusing, yes. -)   10:21 Jan 18, 2003 (UTC)Your refusal to discuss things makes it hard to understand what it is that you are upset about.  You, Vera. YOU.

I have repeatedly stated that I believe a discussion on the origins and varied historical meanings of the word \"imperialism\" are best suited at the page on the word \"imperialism\" rather than at New Imperialism where there is a specific discussion of one imperialist era. I can't really stating that is dodging matters and as far as I know it is the only edit war I am involved with.As for behaving in a way that annoys you...I am sorry I did something that bothered you but I do not remember you ever leaving a message on my talk page pertaining to some action which you found bothersome and I apoligize although I believe the situation would improve if you would try communication instead of \"trolling about trolls\". Tarquin, You asked on my user page if I had looked anywhere to solve my problem of how to access this page I'm writing on so that I can send a message to you (something to do with your updating the FAQ to include the answer). In fact, I was lazy and did no search for the answer. If you are baffled by what I am talking about, just ignore this!.Thanks for the replies to my three questions on the Village Pump.

Thought it best to let you know before you put any more work into the duplicate. merge your text into the old one, it looked to me like you'd written things which aren't in the odler one   00:51 Jan 28, 2003 (UTC)Hi Tarquin,There was a long long discussion on royal naming on Wiki, because numerous styles were being used. A structure was agreed after chats on various pages, on the list and other places. I am in the process of putting the final consensus on the naming page. As most royals do ''not'' have surnames, using surnames is not an option; Correct titles should be used; if they don't have one, the form [Prince/Princess . . . of (country)] was the consensus. Children of the Prince of Wales are known as Prince/ss 'x' of Wales. (I checked it with Buckingham Palace for the discussion). Also, their surname (they do have one) are Mountbatten-Windsor, not Windsor (contrary to widespread myth. (Source: Buckingham Palace and Prince of Wales' office.That is why William is down as 'Prince William of Wales', Harry is 'Prince Harry of Wales' whereas other British royals without titles are or are being changed to 'Prince/ss x of the United Kingdom'   00:24 Feb 1, 2003 (UTC) I've not really been in on this discussion; I appreciate the note but I'm a tad confused why ... are you sure you don't mean to tell this to Tannin?   13:31 Feb 1, 2003 (UTC)Not me. I confess to a total lack of interest in the royals. According to the talk page, you suggested that the supposed surname of Prince William be used. I was explaining why I think this is not correct. As I said there was a major discussion over a number of weeks involving quite a few Wiki contributors, on various pages. I then posted a suggestion on the Wiki list. I have now posted the consensus agreement, incorporating all the suggested changes on how to deal with royal titles on the naming convention page. I also asked those involved in the discussion to look over it to see if it covers all the points of agreement and suggestion. That was the reason behind the message.  20:32 Feb 1, 2003 (UTC) Ah. I remember now... it was a few weeks ago, and I didn't take part in the rest of the debate. But thank you for letting me know -)  tDear Tarquin,Just thought I'd say hello.  As a new user, I am much intrigued by your username - is it because you are known for being 'Superbus'?  We seem to have quite a lot in common, judging by your user page; I quite agree with your 'raves and rants'.  Anyway, I'd better be off for now.  Goodbye! welcome to the wikipedia! Always nice to see new users settling in. Hope you don't find it all too confusing, if you have any questions there's the village pump page somewhere... about the name: sadly, no, there's no connection with Romans.   tYou think if you plead not guilty, she will file an additional defamation suit against your insinuation that she had filed a bogus charge? You know yer goin to jail when I'm supporting you. This Isis thing is just too darn silly for words! Housekeeping is what she did when I tried to talk to her too about the grevious injuries I have done to her. I'm sure you can now understand how frustrating that was. Don't go! Yes, don't go.  Tarquin, please do not leave Wikipedia! Your work is much appreciated and will live on for years to come. I and, I am sure, other Wikipedians will try to help you in case of a real legal threat. Sadly, the risk of such actions can hardly be eliminated, but we're all on your side here. Unfortunately, Jimbo tends to be a bit overtaxed with the administration and Brion keeps out of conflicts on the English Wikipedia, so we have a bit of a power vacuum. But I am sure this will change, and threats like this will not be tolerated. Feel free to contact me by email if you think I can be of any help.  12:28 Feb 3, 2003 (UTC)Could someone exlplain to me what this is about? All this illegal,legal.court case things,Isis, Tarquin is all about?? -fonzy My vote probably doesn't count for much, but I think you should stay, too! If Isis gets the idea that she can drive off anyone who says something she doesn't like, simply by threatening them with legal action, then none of us will be safe... And of course we need all the British people we can get, to prevent the Wikipedia from being too mangled by all those pesky Americans. ;)   13:41 Feb 3, 2003 (UTC)Argh! Another fine contributer gone.

One thing that we Brits ''don't'' have to worry about is silly threats of libel - since McLibel even large corporations are worried about bringing cases in Britain.   17:32 Feb 4, 2003 (UTC)Look, I'm an American, but for what it's worth, I think it would be a damn shame if you left because of this. I think there's overwhelming support on your side, and as such I think you'll find that you will continue to be welcome here. At this point in time, the last thing we need is decent people jumping ship while the rats stay on board.  17:39 Feb 4, 2003 (UTC) Amen to that. Yes, please consider coming back after your much-needed Wikipedia holiday. IMO Isis' threat was overthetop and it was ''her'', not you, that harmed the community by her extreme pettiness.  It would be a great loss to the community if you never came back. Wait wait wait wait wait! What's going on here? Can someone please give some background about this matter, or a link to a discussion that I missed? Tarquin is one of the guys whom I am always glad to see online. For some reason we tend to be online at the same hours of the day quite often. I am always glad to see him editing my prose because I know that his changes will be very valuable. Tarquin has contributed massively to the feel of Wikipedia by bringing many articles to a higher level. I have followed his work in the English and French versions. I do not know him personally, but day after day, he has become a sort of a friend. Please someone tell me (and others) what is going on. In any case, I would be very disappointed to see him go. If his reasons are good enough and applicable to other Wikipedians, then some others might consider taking a break as well.  19:07 Feb 4, 2003 (UTC)erm its messed up, erm tarquin said something Isis miss-understood and nwo is using legal action agasint him, Isis is ignroing tarquion, tarquin is leaving. fonzythanks fonzy. sue me isis, i'm bankrupt. then i can like, countersue for defamation, god bless america.where did that happen? on user pages or on the mailing list?

That would be playing into someone else's hands in a big way.  I need people like you around, to tell me what to do when I get things wrong.  21:22 Feb 4, 2003 (UTC)Please stay with us. 21:38 Feb 4, 2003 (UTC)Have a hol then come back. You know it makes sense! )  08:40 Feb 5, 2003 (UTC)Thank you all for your kind messages, both here and on email. You've restored my confidence in the way we all work together here. This sticky matter has not yet been resolved, but since Isis has voluntarily left and is no longer giving gory details of the Delaware legal system on every other page,  there's no need for me to maintain my exile. So I'm on semi-holiday -)   10:47 Feb 5, 2003 (UTC)Great to see you back. I really mean that. I was worried you were going to stay away.  Cool! Welcome back. Welcome back! Glad to see you didn't stay on holiday too long ;-)  10:57 Feb 5, 2003 (UTC)Welcome back from me too   11:25 Feb 5, 2003 (UTC)wb - fonzyWarmest welcome back, Tarquin! I believe that most of us here volunteer time to build something great, that will be useful for the largest possible public. It is sad to see that such things can happen, even sadder that it happened to you this time, but I guess that ''c'est la vie'' and we should move on and continue the good work. By the way, happy year of the goat!  11:38 Feb 5, 2003 (UTC)Glad you decided to stay. \"The drones need you. They look up to you.\"  11:59 Feb 5, 2003 (UTC)What's that quote from?

It's good to see you back. Glad you're back too, Tarquin - I was beginning to think wikipedia was all about rows and threats of legal action.  But I see it's not. BTW, I hope you don't mind my having corrected something on your User page - it was just changing 'both...are' to 'both...and' Welcome back Tarquin!

Tarquin,Thanks for the informative and helpful comments. )best wishes, 00:02 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC)-TarquinI'm glad you liked the Queneau. It's good to get feedback, best when it's positive.Having said which, I now have to say I don't like what you have done to \"pyrrhic\". I tried to wiggle out of it by moving the page to \"pyrrhic (verse metre)\" but somehow we have ended up with two pages.The point is, this is not a dictionary, so even if the word \"pyrrhic\" has other meanings, they are not relevant in this context. Grumble, grumble.Actually, I think the whole poetry/literature section of Wp is getting very straggly. I'm about to set out a proposal for restructuring the whole thing.Best wishes 10:07 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC)This remark is probably redundant; but I make it anyhow: A few hours ago,I added my first page to the Wikipedia and it is already improved.  It wasa little change but it really (and rationally) makes me feel welcome.Thanks a lot.Hi Tarquin. Just say your note on talk:Tetrahedron, but your userpage would not let me email you. Just send your funky animation to me (snoyes at gmx dot net) - I'll then delete this entry on your talkpage before any spambot can harvest it. Thanks!  22:35 Feb 26, 2003 (UTC)Re:Entente cordiale. I believe there is a policy to not dump the text of historically important documents into Wikipedia. This was discussed recently atTalk:1922 Text: League of Nations Palestine Mandate  Wasn't me that put it there  I found it at a duplicate page Entente Cordiale & merged. I'll remove   08:46 Feb 27, 2003 (UTC)infamous does sound like a somewhat pov term, was billy the kid famous or infamous?  I don't see a problem with it in certain contexts. Did you make those edits under that IP?   21:15 Feb 28, 2003 (UTC)Is it so hard to believe that more than one person can disagree with you? I see a problem with it in all contexts because it seems to be an opinion...  The Dreyfuss affair I think can be described as infamous.   21:19 Feb 28, 2003 (UTC)That is a great opinion, and I value it. I would not object to the article stating, \"Tarquin thinks the Dreyfuss Affair was infamous.\" Others disagree with your opinion however...  Many words decribe things in ways that can't be exactly quantified: ''famous'' and ''infamous'' are both examples of these. To remove these from Wikipedia would be removing important information from the article. Susan Mason, are you the same person as Vera Cruz, with whom I had a discussion about Asimov's famous short stories at the top of this page?   21:24 Feb 28, 2003 (UTC)Tarquin: ''Hey! Stop censoring the word infamous from every article in the name of NPOV!''Tarquin, I'm not censoring it from *every* article, I'm only removing it where it appears that wikipedia itself is declaring something infamous.  I haven't touched it where it is used in a direct quote or when it is used within a fictional context.With regards to POV, ask yourself whether you would consider the word \"disgraceful\" to be be POV if used in the same place.  For example, the \"disgraceful dreyfus affair\".  I maintain that is simply a POV usage.  We can instead use the NPOV \"well known\" or \"contriversial\" or anything else that doesn't cause wikipedia to cast judgement.I disagree, stating that somebody is famous can be attributed by stating that in a recent poll 95% of the world's population knew who they were. There is no need to decide what is infamous or not, it is not informative. No I am not Vera Cruz, and thank you for asking so often. Are you Zoe who also keeps asking me that?  So are you suggesting we carry out a poll of the entire world's population and say \"do you consider the Dreyfuss affair famous, or infamous?\" I'm not Zoe. You can tell, bbecause my writing style is ccompletely different.   21:34 Feb 28, 2003 (UTC)Seems like Zoe to me. No I do not suggest we carry out a poll of the entire world, I think it is best not to have it in the article. However, if you are so intent on discovering what is and isn't famous or infamous, then you can conduct a poll and we can include your results within the article. The poll idea is ridiculous.  I simply don't think that wikipedia should declare things to be \"infamous\".  The word is fine when it is used in a direct quotation, it is fine when it is used in a fictional context, and it is fine when we make it clear who we are attributing it to.Did you mean to revert me at Roy Orbison, or were you trying to revert the anonymous user? I think it's a real song.I thought our wikipedia:policy on deletion was that we don't delete mispellings like list of brittons, but redirect them (to list of Britons, for example).  it was an orphan page, so I figured no need to redirect. sorry   10:59 Mar 4, 2003 (UTC)thanks for updating the margarine article - I've a favour to ask - could you take a look at my proposed naming convention at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (pieces of music) (it's down at the bottom between two horizontal rules) and see if it makes sense. I'm not asking you to get involved in a detailed discussion of its merits if you don't want, but I'd be a lot happier putting the convention into action if I knew somebody other than me had at least looked at it and reckoned it wasn't completely insane. Ta Well, actually my Dad made that margarine page.  I didn't know he stole it.  Sorry. - '''Tarquin deleted \"List of all lists which do not contain themselves\" (cos it's bl**dy stupid and the joke is now old. there's already a list of all lists.)'''Tarquin, I'm saddened that you did this without first submitting this to Votes for deletion.You write above that ''\"there's already a list of all lists.\"'' Could you point this list out to me please?  I've found a pretty nice list at List of reference tables, but it is by no means as comprehensive as the one I had posted at List of all lists which do not contain themselves before you deleted it.If the only choice had been between deleting the list and leaving it as a redirect to Russell's paradox, then I agree that deleting it (after submission to Votes for deletion) would have been preferrable.I can certainly see how a \"list of *all* lists\" on wikipedia may seem silly at first glance, but I've been in the act of editing a \"list of ...\" before and paused to wonder how many of these things there are.  Perhaps, as a developer, you could produce an automatically updated page that lists all articles that begin with \"List of\" so we can keep track of them.If the list matters to you so much I'll resotre it & rename it to List of lists. okay?  t Just navigate your way around from list of lists, etc, or do a wikipedia search for \"list\", and you'll find them all. I still liked the redirect to Russel's paradox, though. Ahh well, I'll survive... ) You've got it back. I'll let you guys handle the move to a non-flippant title   22:38 Mar 8, 2003 (UTC)Looks like be have an abuser , can you please look into this?  thanks. What's the problem? Apart from being yet another person to jump on the non-latin character bandwagon?   23:39 Mar 8, 2003 (UTC)I noticed he put some Arabic islamic chant \"Allah...etc\" on a TALK page I had with someone, and his stuff was completely irrelevant, meaningless and obviously ill-intended.  So I clicked on his ID and from his user page clicked on hist other \"contributions\" and noticed he has done the same thing on a number of pages.  On that basis, I am assuming this is a trouble-maker or at least someone who doesn't haesitate to abuse an open system like Wiki if he finds something to his personal dislike. Ah. I couldn't see what those characters were, and I wouldn't be able to read them even if I had the font. I'll keep an eye out.   00:55 Mar 9, 2003 (UTC)I appreciate your criticism re the Fonts... there needs to be balance, see Wikipedians using foreign sigs, and help clean formalise something. -Actually, from my point of view, you're a British chauvinist.  The fact of the matter is that meter is a much more logical and phonetic spelling than metre.  It's time you Brits or wherever you're from caught up with a bit of logic.  I'm sure that we could revert to all kinds of ridiculous archaic spellings, but it seems to me that Wikipedia is about objectivity, and meter is the more objective spelling.  Not to mention that we should use one standard spelling style, and the precedent was set with American spelling, not British.Exactly - Brits think that they have rights to claim invention of English, and that their literature, culture, and otherwise Angled culture is superiour to that of the Colonies. Which is of course compensation for living on a cold bloody rock for years on end... Its like each of these brits becomes FormerUser:Lir, when it comes to automatically Anglifying terms and syntax. And to blooddy top it all off, talking to one for even a short length of time, eventually makes one begin speaking as if ''he''. too, had been to a boarding school, imprisoned under house arrest on charges of sodomy, and takes their tea with dairy in it. It's bollocks, i say, in my Japanese way -I am rather surprised, and disappointed, at how quickly this has become insulting. Jaknouse says Tarquin is a chauvinist, for which I see no evidence here, and Stevertigo seems to have tried to make the debate descend to the level of a transatlantic flame war in which each side picks out insulting stereotypes about the other ... I really hope this stops now: it is unnecessary and ''never'' benefits anyone. The Manual of Style says ''Spelling style - For the English Wikipedia, either American or English spelling is acceptable. It is in no way a requirement, but it probably reads better to use American spellings in articles on American subjects and English spelling in articles on English subjects.'' This would seem to cover \"metre\" as it was. If we all start to change spellings to meet our own prejudices - and if we enunciate those prejudices in an insulting way - then the wikipedia will lose out in the ensuing edit wars. I feel quite strongly about this. For us to get along some mutual tolerance and respect is needed, and it is not promoted by dragging out those tired stereotypes.   07:12 Mar 12, 2003 (UTC)For the sake of completeness I should add in case it is not clear above that I would be just as disapproving of someone who gratuitously changes \"color\" to \"colour\" on the grounds that it is \"right\" or \"better\" - we just don't do that. I think SV is kidding.... Jaknouse, check the policy Nevilley mentioned. As for \"metre\", since the French invented it, if we ''really'' want to be logical, we should let ''their'' spelling prevail.   09:43 Mar 12, 2003 (UTC)OK, if Steve was kidding then I will blush (rather prettily, actually) and apologise. Though if he was, the irony was perhaps a little deep for me - so maybe also for some other users unless I am actually the Most Naive Here (someone has to be I guess), and if it turns out he's actually British, maybe a bit too self-flagellating to actually be funny rather than just A Bit Worrying ... hmmm ...  10:29 Mar 12, 2003 (UTC) If anyone wants to argue that \"we should use one standard spelling style\", could they take the discussion to wikipedia:manual of style, which is the appropriate place? As Nevilley said, the current guidelines are that both sets of spellings are acceptable, but if this doesn't reflect the views of large numbers of wikipedians then perhaps we should discuss it further? Dear Tarquin:I just wanted to ask you whats your opinion on .I think we need to keep an eye on him. He states he doesnt want his articles edited, he does not seem to listen to other's comments (check all the times hes erased stuff on his talk page) and it seems, by what Ive read, that he doesnt get his facts right. We need to keep an eye on this guy. Maybe he needs a trip to the ''Slammer'' (one of many things I call the wikipedia bans).Just wanted to ask what you think of him..thank you and God Bless you.Sincerely yours,''''perching bird ''Incomplete'' not me, already there.

Es wurde als ''Magna Germania'' zwischen Oder und Weichsel beschrieben. Teile Schlesiens wurden von Kaiser Arnulf von Kärnten dem mährischen Herrscher als Lehen gegeben.Im Jahre 963 wurde das Land zwischen Oder und Netze von Kaiser Otto I. als Reichslehen an Mieszko I., den später so genannten Piastenreich (Geschichte Polens) gegeben. Es wurde unter Herzog Kasimir I. wieder selbständig. Der Stamm der Silinger (s.o.) gab dem Land den Namen ''Silesia'', Schlesia. Weitere deutsche Besiedelung erfolgte im späten Mittelalter. Es entstanden wichtige Städte wie z.B. Breslau. Der südöstliche Teil um die Städte Oppeln und Kattowitz heißt '''Oberschlesien''', er hatte im Unterschied zu '''Niederschlesien''' bereits vor 1945 eine deutsch/polnisch sprechende Mischbevölkerung.Im 16. Jahrhundert wurden Staatsverträge zwischen Schlesien und Brandenburg-Preußen abgeschlossen, wobei Schlesien beim Aussterben der schlesischen Piasten an Brandenburg-Preußen fallen sollte. Die Habsburger HRR Kaiser brachten Schlesien aber in Habsburger Besitz, als 1569 der letzte schlesische Piast starb. Nach dem preußisch-österreichischen Krieg zwischen Friedrich II. und Kaiserin Maria Theresia wurde der größte Teil Schlesiens 1742/44 preußisch, ein kleinerer Teil um Troppau (heute Opava in Tschechien) blieb österreichisch.Nach dem Wiener Kongress 1815 wurde Schlesien eine der zunächst 10 Provinzen des Staates Preußen, wobei Teile der bisher sächsischen Oberlausitz der neuen Provinz eingegliedert wurden. Provinzhauptstadt wurde Breslau.Mit der beginnenden Industrialisierung wurde '''Oberschlesien''' mit seinen Steinkohlebergwerken zu einer wirtschaftlich wichtigen Region.Nach Ende des 1. Weltkriegs kamen Teile '''Oberschlesien'''s an Polen, obwohl vorher der Ausgang einer Volksbefragung für den Verbleib bei Deutschland war. Die verbliebene Provinz wurde 1919 in zwei Provinzen aufgeteilt, Oberschlesien mit der Hauptstadt Oppeln und Niederschlesien mit der Hauptstadt Breslau. Österreichisch-Schlesien kam nach dem ersten Weltkrieg zur Tschechoslowakei und gehört heute zu Tschechien. 1938 wurden beide Provinzen wieder vereinigt und 1941 erneut geteilt.Nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg wurde ganz Schlesien von der Sowjetunion erobert und erhielt polnische Administration, bis auf ein kleines Gebiet um die Stadt Görlitz.In den Jahren 1945/46 fand eine gewaltsame Vertreibung der deutschen Bevölkerung statt. Lediglich in Oberschlesien verblieb eine kleine Minderheit. Statt dessen wurden Menschen angesiedelt, die von Stalin aus ehemals ostpolnischen Gebieten gewaltsam umgesiedelt wurden. \n",

            "International Symposium on Dr Axel MuntheThe second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden.From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peacefulwaters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintingsfrom the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the familywhile also being opened as a museum for the public during the summermonths.The gardens were created by Axel’s wife Hilda on the promontoriesand in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well orderedEnglish garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.For a  full programme of the symposium please contact:.Pia ThunholmStiftelsen Hildasholm,Box 64S-793 22 Leksand,Dalarna, SwedenTel. +46 (0)247 10062E-mail: munthes@hildasholm.orghttp:// www.hildasholm.orgI hope this is of interest and would be grateful if the information was posted on your web.

You're right, of course, that they don't need repeating.  As far as the rest, there was some method in the madness when we started all of this.  We wanted some overlap, but not much, so that we could keep the articles short and to the point.  The idea was that people would follow the links if they wanted to know more, and also, they would be able to search under more terms.  Then we started getting people who were interested in List pages and got the dynasty things ...  At any rate, I still like the idea of several shorter articles, but think some could be consolidated.

            "“The American conservatives were most sternly anti-Soviet, and the magniude of the Soviet's crimes against humanity show that in this they were in the right; the leftist media might downplay these crimes to avoid admitting their political enemies were right all along.Surely the media wasn't leftist during the cold war, when the government ended up instituting legislation against it being so? Huh! You learn something each day...as a technical note, do the crimes of the USSR end up being counted as genocide per se? I was under the impression that genocide referred to the targeting of a particular ethnic group, whereas Stalin pretty much killed people randomly. I think it might be better to use most murderous or some other superlative like that.”By the way, do you think that that above partisan has a sophisticated, objective, scholarly understanding of Russian history? I know that that doesn't matter on the talk pages, but I'm kind of hinting that Wikipedia is not losing insightful dialogue due to my deletions. At least the out-of-place ideological debate could be a bit more elevated.172 - This does not give you the right to delete the comments of others. Cleaning up talk pages is a good idea, especially when the talk has turned unproductive. But if this is done in the middle of a debate, it will be taken as an action within that debate. Best to explain what you're trying to do, or ask first. Even better than deleting would be ''refactoring'' lengthy discussions into simple points. But that's hardly ever done.   17:00 Dec 24, 2002 (UTC)The information deleted included genocide figures from various sources along with comment. 172 was trying to excise this. One might say a 'Stalinist edit'. I will continue to delete that partisan debate.  Don't slander me either. I don't appreciate being called a Stalinist.I would delete Stalinist politicking if it were in the article as well.Why don’t you address this issue to me directly?Slander is not cool. 172 - Why are you deleting estimates of genocide figures and their sources? Why not address my page directly. .Those discussions do not pertain to the article. They’d be relevant if they were, for example, disputing some of the figures in the article. But they’re not. These partisans (the apt term in the Wikipedia lexicon) are merely illustrating how much they dislike the Soviet Union.Not to divert attention from the dispute, but I have to criticize the kind of research evident in the deleted sections.Rather than trying to cite the most sensational figures from black books and Robert Conquest, readers should focus on trying to improve this terribly weak article. The History of the People's Republic of China,for instance, is a far more informative and illuminating article. I take credit for most on the post-Mao era. This article tells you little if anything about the Soviet economy, Soviet society, the Cold War, the origns of the Cold War, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the casuses of the breakup, Perestroika, Glasnost, the Brezhnev Era, the Sino-Soviet Split, Communist ideology. In short, it’s not really going to help people understand why Soviet history unfolded as it did. I look forward to revamping it.Why not talk to me directly? Hello.  I hope you haven't gone away.  I was tinkering with the Lewes article, and noticed that there is nothing there about the avalanche.  Not many (if any) British towns have suffered from such a phenomenon, and I think it deserves a mention, but I don't know much about it.  I can't even remember the year.  Are you on for including it? Why did you disambiguate Boom to Boom, Belgium? AFAIK, Boom is the only town currently having an article in Wikipedia, so there's no need to do that. Or are you planning to include some more Booms? -)  14:24 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC)Move it back if you want. I just thought that in future someone might want to put more stuff at Boom. Was there a band called Boom? I dunno, maybe there's a comic called Boom? or a film.  I've moved it back. Talk:Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)improve the articleI have generally avoided writing about computer science topics and OOP in particular. It's my job, and for me Wikipedia is about things that are not my job. I tinkered with a few words on some articles in the last 24 hours, but I'm not really interested in making major edits to such topics. Yeah, you are right! God I am a glutton for punishment (to use an Irish phrase!). I'm heading off in a couple of minutes. And I won't even think of the Famine, let alone dream of it!!! -)  05:25 Jan 17, 2003 (UTC)Thanks Mintguy, both for moving Bodyline and for teaching me a little more about the technicalities here. I think 172 has good constructive ideas but I think the original worked better. We just have to fight to make sure that changes are accurate and not agenda-loaded. That in trying for consensus, we don't look for the lowest common demoninator, with wacky theories being treated equally with accurate history. Please, please make your views known on the talk page.

Hi Mintguy, Yup, Karen is correct: \"chip\" is standard Oz usage, and the Kiwi term too as I recall. You do hear them called \"crisps\" once in a while, but mostly only by expatriate Britons. Funny you should raise the matter here though - not so long ago, I wrote on it at some length, though without my usual NPOV  over here - Mintie, why didn't you just apologize to Isis? Now she's deleted herself  and the way I had to hear about it was when Jimbo e-mailed me to block her account \"at Isis's request\". Guys like Sheldon Rampton can take care of themselves; he's not going to quit just because he thinks I called him ''disingenous''  he's a published author, runs his own website, has the world by the tail  but sensitive folks like Isis need a little more tender concern and understanding.All you had to do is say, \"Sorry, I didn't mean to question your knowledege or competence. I must have misunderstood you.\" That would have smoothed it over nicely.Please e-mail Isis privately, and try to patch things up. Would you do that, please? As a favor to me? ^_^ I think you got the wrong end of the stick Ed. Please see the comment on your  page. Hello.  Just wanted to say that I think your slant on \"Ironic\" is hilarious, even if you did pinch the basic idea from Ed Byrne.

But obviously the former needs to be deleted before the later can be moved to it. Yep, & nice one for putting it right so fast! ) Goog luck and good night. I'm off to bed, you kept me up! Mintguy RE:line of sucession, ist no lonmger true that sons come before daughters, until recently yes it as true but now its equal, so if Prince william had a duaghter first then a son, the aughter would be heir to teh throne. -fonzyI don't think you are right, and neither does Deb. AFAIK it requires an Act of Parliament to effect such a change in the rules of succession and there hasn't been one. Fonzy is definitely wrong.  It depends on the country, and so far as I know, this is only true in Sweden and the Netherlands, although other Scandinavian countries may have done so, but it is definitely not true of the UK.   Fonzy is 100% wrong. The Law of Succession has ''not'' been changed in the United Kingdom. If William has a daughter then it no doubt will be, but apart from an proposal from Geoffrey Archer (which was soon forgotten about) the law remains has it has remained for centuries.  04:29 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)Bloody vandals. We should let DW loose on them. (Naw. Maybe that's ''too'' cruel. We'll just let Two16 read some of his poetry to them and drive them to insanity!)  04:46 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)I'm unclear why Frigatebirds has been moved to Frigatebird, which did not exist before. I named it as such because I wanted to deal with the group Frigata and link from that to the individual species accounts. To me, it seems bizarre that '''groups''' of birds at genera or higher taxonomic levels aredescribed as eg  vulture or duck. However, as a newcomer to the 'pedia, it may well be that there is some convention that overides normal ornithological   practice. If this is so, could you explain, otherwise can it be moved back.  14:50 Feb 14, 2003 (UTC)Sorry, forgot to log in before last diatribe. What about raptor/raptorsor bird of prey/birds of prey  14:54 Feb 14, 2003 (UTC). Some 40 group monographs advertised in a birders' magazine used the plural invariablly for the title, eg Owls of the World. It is standard practice to use the plural for groups, eg woodpeckers, and capitalised singular for species, eg Great Spotted Woodpecker I didn't move it. I did make a link to frigatebird more direct, and remove a self-reference. It is standard practice in Encyclopaedias to name things in the singular and not the plural. Look at raptor in Encylopaedia Britannica . Only because I haven't made my way to Zevon's house yet... BWA-HAH-HAH!  Seriously, some of the sites I used were obviously unreliable, so I did as much cross-checking as possible.  I'm sure more than one slipped through. '''Help'''. I've uploaded a picture Flanhinga2b which I've checked is viewable in the upload file. However, in the article Anhinga it only shows as a place marker. I've put pictures in Ibis and New World vulture without problems. Any ideas what's wrong? Sorry to butt in, but have you cleared your browser's cache?  the image on that page shows up on my browser.   I just fixed it. many thanks Hi Mint, I notice you called a list of soccer players the List of Football players. Football means different things to different counties and different sportspeople. It could mean Soccer, rugby football, gaelic football, American football, Australian rules football, etc. It is not the right term to use in the context of that article because it has so many ''different'' meanings to different readers of wiki. It should be changed to a more clear term, and the obvious one is soccer.  01:46 Feb 18, 2003 (UTC)Absolutely not!The aritcle resided quite happily under list of famous football players for quite some time until,  decided to rationalise the list of occupations and move it about 2 hours ago. I moved it to list of football players. You can have list of American football players and list of Gaelic football players, but 95% of the world think football is what you're calling soccer and football players belong there. Oops, sorry, I didn't see who created the test page.   Until the page is finished, LEAVE IT where Maverick left then. I'm moving it back to where Maverick left it.  21:28 Feb 18, 2003 (UTC)No you leave it where it was until this time yesterday and for over 1 year previous to that. STOP moving it. If you read some of the FAI and links sites you'd see the use the word soccer. A lot. Look at the talk page right now for more information  23:23 Feb 18, 2003 (UTC)\n",

It probably belongs somewhere, not sure where though:On the spelling of Swedish names: Swedish has been a written language for more than a thousand years, but spelling has not been fixed or stable for more than 70 years.During the 1920s, several words were spelled with ä (a-umlaut, the same character used in German) that are now spelled with e. In 1907 an official spelling reform was made in Swedish schools, replacing \"hv\", \"fv\" and some occurrences of \"-f\" with \"v\" and \"dt\" with \"tt\". For example, the English word \"which\" is still spelled \"hvilken\" in Danish, but \"vilken\" in Swedish - the \"h\" is silent anyway.During the 19th century, older spellings with \"w\" and \"qv\" were replaced with \"v\" and \"kv\", respectively. Further back, more changes had taken place. This also effects personal names. For example, the Swedish name \"Per\" might be spelled \"Pär\". Most often, one person spells his own name in only one of these ways, but in historic times, the spelling variants could change from one year to another.Swedish king Gustav Vasa in the 16th century spelled his own name Göstaff and various historic documents use Gustaff or Gustaf or Gustave (if in France) or Gustaw. Some Swedish historians have used the convention of spelling kings' names with v and c during their lifetime (Gustav, Carl, Oscar) and with f and k after their lifetime (Gustaf, Karl, Oskar), which is certainly confusing and not in line with any English customs.Add to this confusion that Karl XII is known throughout Europe as Carolus (the Latin form of his name), that John is the English form and Johann is the German form of Johan, and that king Sigismund was also the king of Poland./  10:47 Apr 4, 2003 (UTC)\n",

Conscious or not:1.it doesnt belong to Serbian literacy Franc Miklošič had relegated it to due to prevalent mistake of early Slavic philology to attribute all Glagolitic documents to Croatian and all Cyrillic documents to Serbian heritage. In fact, Croatian Cyrillic heritage is well documented (one can visut linx on Croatian language wiki page). Though, there are some arguments that at least a part of Tvrtko 1st charters belong to Serbian cultural heritage since he emlpoyed scriveners from Serbia proper, which affected the orthography and morphology of some charters.but, much more serious objection is that the charter is falsely \"translated\". It has the \"jat reflex\" written as \"ie\", which is impossible, since the first explicit inscription of jat reflex as \"ie\" was recorded in Dubrovnik in 1399. This charter should have, in Latin script, neutral ˘e for world, sv˘et, or, in case the phonetic spelling is used, svit (since almost all Bosnian medieval scriptory tradition is Ikavian, and that includes Tvrtko's charters). The relevant sources are monumental Gregor Čremošnik's: Bosanske i humske povelje srednjeg vijeka and Marko Vego's: Zbornik srednjovjekovnih natpisa Bosne i Hercegovine, I.-IV.. The first Ikavian inscription of jat reflex was actually in Bosnia, 1337. This Tvrtko's charter has old jat, has nothing specifically \"Serbian\" (except the scrivener) and I dont see any reason to have it here.\n",

Io ho come base, una enciclopedia molto recente \"Handbook of the Birds of the World\" di Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliot e Jordi Sargatal dell Lynx Edicions di Barcellona.La trattazione degli uccelli è molto ampia e dettagliata con l'indicazione anche di Rhea pennata, ma come primo inizio identificativo, sostituito poi con Pterocnemia pennata. Poiche il libro è completo, mancano solo gli \"oscini\" o passeracei, che sono ancora in corso di produzione, ritengo di tenerlo come base per utti i miei articoli, eventualmente si puo creare la voce Rhea pennata, con un \"REDIRECT\" verso Pterocnemia pennata.OK?

            "-As I mentioned elsewhere, I think it would be a good idea for this page's list of the Emperors to focus on dynastic and non-dynastic changes (so as to justify its separate listing of the Emperors). I put together an example of how this might be accomplished with the Julio-Claudians as an example:'''Julio-Claudian Emperors:'''Caesar Augustus (\"Imp.  Caesar Augustus\"; b. C. Octavius), d. 14M. Vipsanius Agrippa, 18 BC – 12 BCTi. Claudius Nero, 6 BC – 1 BC, 4 – 14 (as \"Ti. Iulius Caesar\")Tiberius I (\"Ti. Caesar Augustus\"; b. Ti. Claudius Nero), 14 – 37''Note:'' Tiberius had been co-Emperor with Caesar Augustus from 6 BC to 1 BC, and again from AD 4 until his own accession to the purpleGaius \"Caligula\" (\"C. Caesar Augustus Germ.\"; b. C. Iulius Caesar Germ.), 37 – 41Claudius I (\"Ti. Claudius Caesar Augustus Germ.\"; b. Ti. Claudius Drusus), 41 – 54Nero (\"Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germ.\"; b. L. Domitius Ahenobarbus), 54 – 68'''Dynastic Relationships:''''''Caesar Augustus''''s third wife Livia Drusilla (subsequently \"Iulia Augusta\") had previously borne two children by her first husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero: '''Tiberius''' and Drusus. Tiberius's second wife was Iulia, Marcus Agrippa's widow (his first wife had been Vipsania, Agrippa's daughter by his first marriage); Caesar Augustus adopted Tiberius on June 26, 4, whereupon Tiberius himself adopted his brother Drusus's son by Marcus Antonius's daughter, Germanicus Iulius Caesar. Germanicus married Vipsania Agrippina, Agrippa's daughter by Iulia and Tiberius's stepdaughter, and had by her one surviving son, '''Gaius \"Caligula\"''' (\"Bootkins\"), and a daughter, Iulia Agrippina, whose second husband was Germanicus's brother by blood, '''Claudius''' (she was his fourth wife); Agrippina had already borne a son (Lucius) by her first husband, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. Claudius adopted Lucius under the name '''Nero''' in 40; Nero married Claudius's daughter Octavia in 53.What does everyone think about using this as a general model for the article's second part? It will of course take some time to modify the whole article, and will necessarily make the article somewhat lengthier, but I think it would go a long way toward demonstrating the complicated (dare I say, \"byzantine\"?) often-familial nature of the Roman Emperor's succession.

Il était le fils de Gedeon Granger qui occupa pendant plus de treize ans (1801-1814) le fauteuil de Postmaster général des Etats Unis dans les cabinets de Jefferson et Madison. Tout naturellement, le jeune Francis s'orienta vers les études juridiques, reçut son diplôme de Yale et devint membre du barreau de l'Ontario lorsque son père déménagea à la fin de son mandat pour s'installer à Canandaiga, dans l'état de New York.A de nombreuses reprises, il représenta le comté de l'Ontario à la législature de New York. Par deux fois (1830, 1832), il fut candidat au poste de Gouverneur sous la bannière du parti anti-mason. Dans les deux occasions , il fut battu par une courte majorité démocrate. En 1836, le parti Whig ayant décidé de mener plusieurs candidatures régionales pour l'élection présidentielle, il fut choisi pour le poste de vice-président sur deux tickets, l'un avec William Harrison, l'autre avec Daniel Webster. Il récolta 77 mandats de grands élécteurs. Personne n'ayant obtenu la majorité pour la vice-présidence, un tour supplémentaire fut nécéssaire devant le sénat conformément aux dispositions du douzième amendement. Granger fut défait par Richard Mentor Johnson.En 1841, à l'accession du général Harrison à la présidence, Granger fut choisi pour entrer dans le cabinet en tant que Post master général. Son passage y fut bref en raison de la démission collective du cabinet suite au décès du président. Après un dernier mandat au congrès, il entra dans la vie privée et stationna dans une semi retraite, ce qui ne l'empêcha pas d'intervenir dans les grandes occasions et sur les grands faits de société.Il se positionna désormais comme un des grands leaders des conservateurs à l'intérieur du parti Whig. Il chapeauta un groupe de politiciens au sein duquel on trouvait William B. Preston, John Crittenden, lawrence Abbott, John Bell, Edward Everett, Washington Hunt (les silver grays). Il cultiva l'amitié d'Henry Clay et de Daniel Webster, appuya toutes les solutions de compromis, multiplia les appels à l'union et au respect de la constitution et prit position contre les progressistes comme Seward ou Stevens.En 1861, il apparut un dernière fois sur la scène en tant que membre de la comission de la paix qui tenta vainement de désamorcer le conflit civil sur le point de s'enclencherGranger se retira dans ses propriétés à Canandaigua et mourut le 28 Août 1868..\n",

            "Thanks for the information. We newbies probably look really stupid sometimes. not at all. Did you follow the bit about private namespace prefix? I typed it rather hastily. It is quite a useful feature.  Yes, thanks. I'll use it in future. I've moved your user talk, originally named Archive 1 to , bringing it into your user namespace. - Well, there are two ways; you can move the page or just cut and paste but I can't find any guidelines on which of these is correct or preferred. Personally, I have always used cut and paste as I think it makes more sense for the page history to be kept together in one place. When I archive an article talk page I only archive the older discussion. I leave anything still current on the page which avoids the problem of people replying in an archive. Perhaps you need to find someone who archives using the 'move' method and find out what their justifications for that are. I can't see any advantage in it really, and the fact that the archive is then added to watchlists is a bit annoying. Yeah, I always go with cut-n-paste for archives too, since they're effectively  read-only repositories of ancient text, and the single page history at the talk page can give you every change back to the beginning even if most of the text was later archived. I suppose we ought to write this down somewhere, the first time I did I was completely unsure about what to do. Re: Neustadt. Can you give me a source? Everything I can find says England.  Hmmm, see what you mean. Another user mentioned on a (Talk page in a different context that the reference in that article should have been to ''Wellfleet, Mass.'' However, checking things, I see the ''Guardian'' says he died in London . However, the reference to Welfleet, England (sic) is still wrong; he did have a summer house in ''Wellfleet, Mass.'' Just delete it I would say.This will teach me to believe what I read on Talk pages!!!  As I recall, I made two changes to the page. In the first, I altered the text in a major way. I suppose that I should have indicated what I was doing, but I believe that to be the only breach of the Wikipedia's rules and conventions. Any minor edit I made was to correct a spelling mistake. If I did mistakenly mark the main change as a minor edit, then you have my profuse apologies.Coming on to the NPOV point, what do you disagree with? Malathir's comments were racist. He has made similar comments in the past consistently enough that I feel labelling him a racist is quite correct. If you want, I will dig up some specific quotes for you. I accuse him of having a myopic view of Judaism. Myopia is not seeing what is really there due a vision fault. If he is an anti-Semite and racist, then his rantings about Jews controlling the world qualify as myopia about Jews. I then do not say that such views are common in the Muslim world. I say that they are common enough to cause concern. Many people I know share those concerns, and they are reflected amongst larger sections of the western world than just people I know.Finally, the point about Nazi ideology may well have stuck in your craw. I did not say that lightly. Take a look at the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem; he was best buddies with Adolf Hiter. The Mufti's nephew learnt much of his hatred of Jews from his uncle. That nephew is Yasser Arafat. He represents one of the more extreme versions of Muslim anti-Semitism, and he is only one step away from picking it up directly from Hitler himself. Malathir is not that bad, but he is still a vicious bigot. He comes from a region that is supposedly known for its moderate version of Islam, in a country that is one of the most secular in the Muslim world. However, he still produces bilge on Jews ruling the world etc.I unprotected  - assuming accidental/old vandal/etc. If deliberate, please re-protect and drop a quick line of explanation on wikipedia:protected page and/or on the page itself. Thanks. Thanks for protecting Mother Teresa.  I have been just about fed up with Wiks unilateral decision to start an edit war. I was adding stuff, and i thought there was a Criticisms of Mother Teresa article which had already been decided on, so I removed the info that kept being added. Well, whatever. In any case, Alexander, please take my advice: take Mother Teresa off your Watchlist and work on some of your own article projects for awhile. Don't get burned out on that particular issue. Thanks for your note. Take care...  Viajero: I think a post of mine in the talk page of MT's page is interesting because some info (all concerning her beatification and so on) has disappeared in the mess and from the talk page, everybody agreed that this section was OK (it took Adam quite a while to work out his article and now it is crippled). There is no discussion in the talk page concerning that section but it was when Adam's version was first included and now it is not. I know it may be quite controversial, but it is just fair (in my opinion, of course...). TIA. Hola, yes, I know the passage you are referring to:After her death, the Holy See immediately began the process of beatification, the first step towards possible canonization, or sainthood. This process requires the documentation of a miracle, and in autumn 2002, the Vatican recognized the healing of a purported tumor in the abdomen of Dangram, India resident Monica Besra through the application of a locket containing Teresa's picture. Her husband disagrees and believes that the lump in her adomen was not cured by divine intervention, but by later hospital treatment. Meanwhile, according to a TIME Asia report, records of her treatment have been taken away by a member of the order, and the Balurghat Hospital where Besra was treated reported coming under pressure from the missionaries to acknowledge that the healing process was the result of a miracle. [1] Despite the controversy, on 19 October 2003 Pope John Paul II made a formal pronouncement that Agnes Bojaxhiu had been beatified by the church. Teresa's miraculous intercessory powers will need to be further confirmed by the Catholic Church before she is elevated to sainthood. It is this, right? I remember it because I also edited this section once about a month ago  it was the only direct involvement I have had in the text. I had to go way back to mid-October to find, at least at 100 versions earlier(!!!). I don't think it is controversial  it was even one of the parts of the text that Adam took over from the earlier version  and certainly belongs in the text. At this point though I don't know what to say. Someone will have to take responsibility for mediating some kind of compromise. When that happens, we can insure the text is reinserted.  Sorry, I did not clarify. There are two sections missing (\"Teresa as a Celebrity\" and \"Beatification of MT\") which were around just before Alexandros started his last sequence of edits, then 2toise reverted his deletions on the criticisms (which is OK) but kept his deletions and \"mis\"-edits in the \"\"pro-\"\" section. It will be more complicated than I thought, but I think as they were in Adam's version and were there till Alexandros' multiple edits, they should appear. No action now, thanks. Sorry for writing so large for so little. I think we might get an easy agreement in the talk page. Don't bother and thanks. I'll keep an eye on it; don't want to do it just yet as they've only had one round so far today. - I've suggested an alternative at Wikipedia talk:How to archive a Talk page. I'm not sure whether that should go on the help page though as I don't know whether any objects to the method. Hello. I am glad to see you in the Latin America Wikiproject. Do not hesitate to edit that page. Hola amigo, ya sabías que me interesa mucho este parte del mundo, pero por disgracia recién hoy descubré esta página. Sí, queda mucho para hacer. ¡Adelante!  A lot of what he's put on Current Events recently has been a bit borderline as to being of general interest news. Hi, before you archived your talk page I wrote \"Hmmm, I don't know who this 'niceguy' is. I assumed at first he was Heine as he moved Heine off the page a while ago, but I doubt that now. I doubt it's a newbie either\". I've just realised Heine and Nico are (probably) the same person, so I'm reverting to my initial assumption that niceguy is (probably) Heine, hence such removals from Wikipedia:problem users should be watched more closely. Thanks for the work on Brian Coffey: your intro is much stronger than mine was. I've added a paragraph on his later life that somehow got lost earlier. I seem to be on a run with obscure modernists amd groups of modernists at the moment, and it's nice to see someone is reading what I'm doing. Could you copy your list comments to wikipedia talk:problem users? There's been previous discussion about renaming, and it'd be good to keep it in one place. answer@mother_teresa. )Thanks for the compliment. I realize I am not the easiest-to-be-read writer, though. Especially when I get worried. On the lovely Mother Teresa - I'm waiting for agreement from Mr Plank before doing *anything*. Sorry to bother you, but after reading your recent arguments with martin and jtdirl, I think it would be best to refer you to Wikipedia:wikiquette.  The line reading, ''No personal attacks; while criticising the work of other contributors is fine, personal attacks and insults regarding their race, sex, creed etc. are unacceptable. For further guidance, see No personal attacks.'' especially applies to your comments. I think I must tell you  what I am about to post at the talk page. If you find it too harsh, please do tell me. I will wait for your answer before pasting it in the Mother Teresa talk page. Thanks. Thanks for the compliment. I posted it on the mailing list. From your comments I guess you are not happy - although I believe that Pfortuny is. I don't know what Adam Carr thinks - I would not be happy if the article pleases only the catholics - because this will not have solved the problem. Sure, I'll try to keep an eye on it, but I'm not going to be around for much this evening. I made the comments in his page bc I did not want to have this conversation in public (I guessed you were not in agreement )...On one hand I really thought something like what Ed did was necessary to keep the article going on, but I felt quite quite sorry at Adam's withdrawal. But I prefer freedom to depending on someone for editing an article.I was surprised at Ed's unblocking the page, but then I thought \"someone should do it, anyway\". I also never assumed my opinion would be definitive for the unblocking... It is quite messy. I am happy for the \"unblocking\" but unhappy for Adam's going away and your (and others, I guess) worries......My mind is not too clear, as you can see. Thanks for the welcome.  Answer in my  page. Don't want to waste your disk space )Viajero, concerning your open letter:I never actually ''wrote'' I was a Catholic anywhere. Is it so obvious? )You are right. The debate needs and has to be faced. If this is a serious project to last for a good while, these problems have to be studied and solved \"in general\".On the other hand, if I may be a bit personal... We would be more convincing if there were no harsh words in our writings. No offence intended, simply thinking aloud.Again thanks for your help and please inform me if the above debate begins. Nop! You guessed I am a Catholic, and I am one, so why not saying it? I was simply kidding.The harshness referred not to our conversation (it has NEVER even approached harshness) but some words in one comment of yours in the MT talk page after Ed's unblocking and in the letter to Ed. I did not mean you had been harsh to me ever, sorry for not being clear!Yes, my words are not written in stone, but... I got so annoyed at Eloquences behaviour I thought it was best for me to withdraw for a while. I'll think it twice, though ) Quick question: how can I ask for Irish literature to be removed from Pages needing attention? If you think it no longer needs to be listed, just delete it yourself!   Will do. Thanks again for all your help. I need your advice. A newbie whose first language clearly is not English has added two paragraphs at the start of Poetry. These are poorly written and I do not believe thaey belong anyway. However, I'd be the last person to want to discourage an enthusiastic newcomer. Could you have a look at the page and suggest a suitable course of action? Thanks Let see, ummm Poetry... Page History... Mrs.Medha... User contributions... Yep. We are in total agreement on one thing: her text has got to go. Now, you have basically two options, depending on your ''humeur'': You can revert the text with a terse comment in the Summary. Or you can \"move\" her text to the Talk page with a comment about it \"needing work\". If you want to be exceedingly diplomatic, you could even leave a note on her Talk page, thanking her for her contribution, saying that it wasn't quite encyclopedic, and referring her to Wikipedia:NPOV and other help/style pages, and saying that you hope she will continue to contribute after familiarizing herself with the site etc. etc. (This will partly depend on whether you think she is just passing by or a keeper.)Hope this helps.  Thanks. I won't revert. Good correction on Current events. I hadn't realised I had removed the cocoa link reference when I removed some other ones. Thats what comes from watching TV and editing a page at the same time! Good revertion. Wikilove. Blanaid Salkeld: thanks again. A much better intro.

            "Poznan was, is and will be an important Polish city. It was the Polish capital in 10th-11th century. The first historical Polish duke Mieszko I and the first Polish king Boleslaw I the Brave are buried in Poznan cathedral.In a overhelming majority of its 11-centuries history 900-2003 it belonged to Poland, except a small periods when it belonged to Prussia (1793-1806) and the Third Reich (1939-1945). Even in years (1815-1918) it was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Poznan under Hohenzollern kings but with the guarantee of free develpoment of Polish nation and language.There is no doubt that there were many German-speaking inhabitants of Poznan, invited by Polish dukes and kings to settle here, and they played a significant role in the city development, culture and history. But the German speaking inhabitants of Poznan were most of the time loyal subjects of Polish kings and patriotic defenders of their Polish homeland.The ethnic German inhabitants of Poznan were the fucking good Poles, as good and patriotic as any others Polish citizens regardless of their ethnic origin, religion, culture, business or social status.There's no doubt that Poznan is an old Polish city, and I find it very very rude, nationalistic and stupid to call it a German city in any period of time.And it is very silly to publish such a nonsense 20 times a day from an anonymous IP.You are invited to find some new material to ''add value'' to Poznan article, and when refering to Polish-German relations please follow the example of German and Polish historians who are working together to produce one common version of history and clarify much of the confusion produced by the 19th century nationalisms:Polish-German relations in Middle Ages (ed.)

I think \"exodus\" is fairly neutral, but I tried to expand on that somewhat, to present the circumstances of their flight. Any sugjestions on how this could be better phrased would be appreciated. -  01:47, 2 Sep 2003 (UTC)Minority is precisely defined term, and only the Government of Serbia (or perhaps even SCG, I'm not sure) can officialy recognise a minority. Kosovo ruling structures can not and have not anyway. There are probably more Chinese then, say, Egyptians in Serbia but they are not recognised as minority. Are Russians minority in Chinese quarter of Moscow? Of course not. All right, you might think that they are, but even then you have to agree that \"minority\" has two meanings: official minority and minority in numbers and so it is the best to avoid amiguation.  06:12, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)That makes no sense whatsoever. Minority means that there are less of one group than of another, since their are fewer Serbs in Kosovo than Albanians that makes them a minority  19:00, 5 Sep 2003 (UTC)That is not the only meaning of the term. Another meaning exists and it is the best to avoid ambiguity.  19:20, 5 Sep 2003 (UTC)New Constitution was more democratic, old Constitution of 1974 was simply dictate from above and was Communist to the core, the new Constitution of 1990 allowed for larger civil freedoms (freedom of speech and gathering), banned the one-party state-rule and allowed for democratic elections in which the people elected a president and an Assembly instead of simply nominating each Communist delegate's name to a specific function which could be likened to the musical chairs game with a chair being added instead of taken away each time.Agreed. The current version says the new constitution was more democratic.The process was and is ethnic cleansing, as simple as that. Read the news, Serbs are getting attacked left and right throughout Kosovo, the terror is now spreading to FYROMacedonia once more.\"Ethnic cleansing\" is a pejorative term. It has no place in an encyclopedia. If Serbs left because of attacks by Albanians then write that, but don't label it \"ethnic cleansing\".The question of a minority has much more to do with the legal framework, besides, Kosovo is not an independent state or any such entity but a part of Serbia-Montenegro as recognized by UN resolution 1244. Thus, Serbs are not a minority in Kosovo, legally still part of their country despite the number of Albanians just as Germans cannot be considered a minority in some particular part of Berlin, for example, which it might happen, has an overwhelming Turkish or Kurdish population. 0:22, 7 Sep 2003 (UTC)In English, a minority is \"a relatively small group of people differing from others in the society of which they are a part in race, religion, language, etc.\" It has nothing to do with legal status or independence. Germans are a minority in Turkish neighbourhoods of Berlin, Whites are a minority in San Francisco's Chinatown, etc. However, I don't think there's anything wrong with the current version which says \"other non-Albanians\". -  01:04, Sep 7, 2003 (UTC)Nikola, please keep the \"See also\" link to \"National awakening and birth of Albania\". It ''is'' relevant, just read it. If you think it is'nt NPOV then go for it. I added a link to the \"Battle of Kosovo\". You may add other relevant links. \n",

            "Szopen:On extermination:The word \"extermination\" does not just mean \"killing a lot of people\" oreven \"mass killing of selected groups of people\" (as in Operation Tannenberg. It means killing '''everyone'''.Hitler set out to ''exterminate'' the Jews, and in Poland at any rate he came close to succeeding.He did '''not''' set out to ''exterminate'' the Poles, at least not in the immediate term. If he had wanted to exterminate the Poles, what sense did Operation Tannenberg make? Why target the national elite if you intend exterminating the entire nation?I don't dispute for a second the enormous suffering of the Polish nation in WW2. You cite a figure of 1.9 million - I actually said 3 million earlier, and the article says that too. But in a nation of 30 million that is not ''extermination.''You note that I obtained the Heydrich quote from a Jewish wesbite. Are you alleging that the quote has been faked by \"the Jews\"? If not, why does it matter where I got it from? This just reflects (IMHO) the Polish paranoia about the Jews. As I said earlier, I understand the historical reasons for this, but people who want to be historians need to make an effort to overcome these sentiments.On General Plan Ost, I didn't say I didn't know what it was, I said the sentence you inserted into the article didn't '''explain''' what it was, and therefore it just served to confuse the reader. If you think it is important, write a paragraph on ''Hitler's plans for Poland'' and put it in.As I said to GH recently, I am '''not''' anti-Polish - if i was why would I bother writing this article, as well as articles on Wladislaw Sikorsky, Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, Zofia Kossak-Szczucka and Jan Karsky, all people I greatly admire? But it is the historian's job to separate facts from national mythology, and to try to present what happened with objectivity, even when (particularly when) the subject-matter is as painful as this.Cheers, \n",

But it's better to have a non-standard categorization than not to have the information at all, so in the end I think you should do whatever you think is best - you could use these categories, or just give a description of policy in each country in an alphabetical list, or go with whatever other categorization you want to. It can always be changed later.Another thing to consider is that some of those classifications will be disputed by other contibutors. \"Politiques d'assimilation\", in particular, could be quite controversial the way it is defined on the site you're referencing. I understand that you've already had difficulties over Québecois history, so you know the kind of thing to expect even if you're doing you're best to be fair. In particular, ''even if you're right'', I'd be cautious about labelling North Cyprus, Northern Ireland, etc. as bad guys unless you're sure you want to defend that position. Better to describe their policy, and allow the user to conclude that the aim is to marginalise certain languages, than to start out by saying so.As you've probably realised anyway, including anything like \"Enfin, il faut souligner fortement que le territoire actuel de l'Irlande du Nord constitue aujourd'hui un anachronisme destiné à protéger ''ad nauseam'' la minorité anglo-protestante de l'île d'Irlande.\" , is out of order (it would also be out of order to say the opposite, that N.Irish Catholics should give up and accept that British and protestant rule is the right thing).

            "I just wrote a particularly heated response to you on Wikipedia:Village pump. Please don't take it personally, as I have nothing but respect for you as a Wikipedian and (as well as someone can know someone over the 'pedia) as a person. I'm just disagreeing with a specific set of statements on a specific issue. Wikilove.  nice case of doublethink there. Have you been practicing? None of my comments were directed at people in particular, but the past week I have been dealing with a LOT of US bias and blinkered US-POV in articles. I felt this particular news item made a suitable wake-up call.   That's just the problem, your comments ''should'' have been directed at people in particular. The alternative is to brand all US contributors. I'm not saying there's no US bias. I'm not saying that we shouldn't try to eliminate US bias and US-POV (along with other bias and POV, btw). But the problem is when you write something like this:This would seem to suggest that US writers have an inflated view of the importance of US events  or they assume they are writing for the US, not for the world. it's ''really'' hard to not take that as an insult. I'm not saying you were at all being ''intentionally'' rude, just that it seems to me to read that way. Again, no doublethink, I really do respect you. It's just your ''wording'' that I take issue with. I said it was your statement when I was writing above. That's not really true as we agree that US bias should be eliminated.  point taken. I should have said \"some US writers\" or even \"the wikipedia group-mind has...\"   I think a lot of the problem was that, for you, the Brazilian Space Agency thing wasn't the sole cause of your rant, merely the final straw?  When that happens, and the rant's just about that final straw, to someone else it often seems like the rant is overblown and disproportionate to the stated issue  because it's about more than that. We're also dealing with two seperate issues of bias.  The explosion not being put up as major news probably IS a case of news from outside the English speaking world being considered unimportant.  That nobody had written an article about the Brazilian space agency, though, is a quite different issue, and you're not going to get many people agreeing that it speaks to anything more than us not having many people here who know about the subject.  Naturally, and inevitably, the English-language Wikipedia is going to have fuller coverage of English-speaking nations. I'd suggest also that THAT bias is not a 'US bias'.  It's a bias towards nations where English is spoken.  I feel it's a little much to characterise such a bias as being the fault of the US or American writers, except inasmuch as they numerically form the majority of the world's speakers of English as a first language. I suspect, also, that a degree of such bias is inevitable.  Contributors to Wikipedia are always more likely to write about what they know; thus more likely to write about things in the nations that they know or for which more sources can be found in the language they know.  Granted, we should work against such bias as much as we can but I doubt that we can ever eliminated it; furthermore, I expect Wikipedias in other languages have equivalent biases.  I'm sure I saw someone say the largest English-speaking nation is India...   As a FIRST language?  Few Indians I've known have had English as their primary tongue, though Indians may indeed comprise the largest group who know English.

            "Hi, can I ask, why you removed the link from the name Sophie on theBFG page?http://www.sophie-dahl.com/hello.htm  12:58 22 May 2003 (UTC)Could you make me an administrator? So far I've been told to wait for Ed Poor.  I'm not a developer, so sorry, I can't.   20:53 May 9, 2003 (UTC)I'm glad you agree, Tarquin, but you agree with what? With Cunc's qustion? Or with my response to it (on his talk page and in Talk:Communist state  09:43 May 10, 2003 (UTC)Well, my thoughts are pretty much this: it's daft having two articles which seem to be on the same thing I don't know enough about the subject to know whether: there ''should'' be two articles under these two names, but the content needs reworking there should only be one article Fred's stuff reads like anti-commie propaganda not sure why Cunc leapt in to his defense like he did having two articles only feeds Fred's ''M''POV plan, and I don't want wikipedia to get infected with this meme in short, I should probably stay away from it, as I don't have sufficient knowledge in the field. we could water down Fred's stuff by saying \"since there have been only ''n'' communist states so far, and most of them suffered from prior problems, the following generalizations are just that, and from a very poor sample space\"  12:55 May 10, 2003 (UTC) oh and PS: I trust your judgement in this matter -)Yea. Sigh. It ''could'' be done in one. Maybe. But if so, only by a group of people working together with goodwill and without a political barrow to push. The trouble with Fred's stuff is that it's mostly right (barring exaggerations) but ... well, let me put it this way: I watched a football match on TV just now. My side scored 16 goals and I remember every one of them. ''So far as I recall'', the other side scored nothing. So how come the scorebook says that we only won by 5 points? (5/6th of an Aussie rules goal) (Because I ignored all their ''good'' plays, of course, as a good Collingwood supporter should.)It's that sort of 'truth' that he writes, and the thought of the time it would take me, you, and 17 others to balance it up by deleting exxagerations, adding qualifications, and rounding the thing into a coherent whole terrifies me. I just don't have the time for that stuff. If I thought it was just a matter of doing it ''once'', sure. But, allowing for reversions, sabotage, and assorted kinky distractions, I'd lose ''at least'' a solid week of good editing time.Right now I'm averaging two good, solid new fauna entries a day, and the only time they ever get modified is when I get something horribly wrong, or sometimes when I sing out for some help. What would I rather have? One article about the things that Fred hates so passionately and 14 good new fauna entries?   Or no new fauna entries, and a protracted edit war over an article that would otherwise be so biased that no-one would take it seriously anyway?I write very slowly, Tarquin, and for every word I write I read quite a few hundred, checking as I go. (My local bookseller loves me - and so he should, the amount I spend there!) I really don't have the moral courage to take on someone with opinions ten times larger than his factual knowledge. (This sticks out like dog's balls: any historian would spot it in 10 seconds flat.) Perhaps I should, but to hell with it. Besides, fauna is more important.Best  I understand your position entirely. -) Fauna ''is'' more important.   17:06 May 10, 2003 (UTC)Tarquin, look at the Cow page. There is a picture, not a diagram. JohnQ sure. it's a lovely cow. the cow goes moooooooo!!!! your point?   17:06 May 10, 2003 (UTC) Some people would have said this is a mooo point. I mean, to be neutral, the best is to think how we produce common articles. Of course we can put a warning text, and I think this is a good thing. But the photograph is the best! JohnQ  my cat's name is mittens   At least, you don't loose your sense of humor. Good! I like this kind of attitude. ;-) llort a era uoyHow old are you? (MaryMary alias JohnQ) You first, kid.

Jean Q... Jean Cul etc.... 22:21 May 11, 2003 (UTC)Tarquin, I don't understand your interlanguage hack you described on the wiktech list and then linked to on the Wikipedia:WikiMoney page. Could you describe it to be in more detail? Sure. Suppose we have a set of pages to link together on en, fr, eo, de and es. Each of those 5 pages needs a ''different'' list of links: en needs: fr, eo, de and es fr needs: en, eo, de and esSo if you have all 5 pages open, you need to do a LOT of copying and pasting. The most efficient way is to put together a list of all 5 page links, and paste it to each page. Then delete the \"self-link\".My idea is this: simply have the system ''ignore'' the self-link. So you paste the ''same'' thing onto each page: en, fr, eo, de, esMuch less work -) It's only meant to be a temporary solution until we get some sort of form system running. But since that may not be for a while, this seems to me to be a quick hack that wouldn't take much to implement.Specifically, the system ignores any link of the form [[xx:anything]], where xx is the language code of the ''current wikipedia''. So on the English wikipedia, [[en:foo]] has no effect, it's just ignored.   19:34 May 12, 2003 (UTC)That alone would help out a lot - it is a pain in the arse to make the separate lists.  go tell the dev list, mav! I've had zero feedback ion the idea apart from Anthere saying it was a good idea.   19:42 May 12, 2003 (UTC)Thanks for fixing Hull for me! I moved it with exactly that intention, then somehow forgot that I was working on it.  08:34 May 13, 2003 (UTC)Thanks for fixing the redirect on AOC. I think I might have left the database in an inconsistent state by clicking the move button twice, but it looks like it's fixed now. Thanks,  22:51 May 13, 2003 (UTC)Argl, j'avais pavu que tu passais par là ; j'ai mis tout ça au clair, avec l'orthographe correcte  Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée ; j'ai modifié ttes (!) les pages de redirection, ainsi que les pages avec les entrées fautives ; cependant, il y a un lien sur lequel je dubite et m'interroge  TLA, qui cause d'informatique !

Let me know if you need more detailed info.  Regards,    15:42 17 May 2003 (UTC) thanks! but weird.... I still get the messages from the list. confusion abounds ..   15:51 17 May 2003 (UTC) talk to Tarquin, if you are around, would you please give your advice on José BovéOtherwise, I am gonna move absolutely EVERY disputed article in the meta space, and it is gonna be messy. Your advice ?Re SI prefix: The \"new material\", as you call it, was at prefix, together with a request to merge it with SI prefix.  08:36 20 May 2003 (UTC)Tarquin, I'm no maths guru, but I confess to some suspicion of 's contributions so soon after the other nonsense, now deleted. Mind running an eye over them?  13:42 20 May 2003 (UTC) physics rather than maths. I'm not sure, best ask TOby or Axel.   16:24 20 May 2003 (UTC)Axel says he's OK. Good! We need more quality contributors. Thanks Tarquin. In magnitude you said \"the modulus of -5 is 5\". What do you understand is the meaning of \"modulus\"? I know two conflicting mathematics definitions of the word: the absolute value (as here), and to divide and take the remainder (\"%\" in C) in modular arithmetic. Do you know which is correct, or are they related in some way?  16:14 21 May 2003 (UTC). I caught you on Village Pump, so you can ignore this.  16:18 21 May 2003 (UTC).You mention you are a \"sloppy typist\" (you didn't say if it was slow/painful or not, btw)  you might like speech recognition (no typos, just misrecognitions). Try IBM Via Voice or Dragon Naturally Speaking (I use the latter). With some practice, it's really nice and fast (but you /do/ need practice).http://groups.yahoo.com/group/VoiceGroup is a good place if you decide to give it a go.   thanks for the recommendation. I have an old IBM viavoice (the 98 version I think  it dictates to Word or its own text editor, but not to other apps unless I've set it up wrong). The problem is one of habit. dictating a written text is fine  if I want to type up a quotation from a book, no problem. But for things I'm making up as I go along, like PG Wodehouse I find I make too many hums and has and pause often. It's very annoying to have these turn into words! on the other hand, I know people who say they can't type directly, they must write on paper first, and I think they're bats. So it's probably a habit I could acquire with practice   16:48 31 May 2003 (UTC) I'm not sure about viavoice, but Dragon lets you dictate anywhere (and create super-cool macros to do repetitive tasks). I agree that \"composing out loud\" takes some practice, but you get used to it. And it's nice when suddenly you have a burst of words coming up to be able to spit it all out without being limited by typing speed (yeah, I do type pretty fast  but I speak faster!). You get to correct it after of course, but at least it's recorded -) (if you dig in my weblog you might find something I wrote about composing-typing, composing-writing, composing-dictating and the effect of dictating on style... maybe in French)  Determine the veracity of this statement: As x approaches 0, F(x) = 1 / x2 is not approaching a limit as it is unbounded; a function which approaches infinity is not approaching a limit. Note that as x approaches infinity, F(x) = 1 / x2 does approach a limit of 0.I am of the understanding that this is '''the''' '''P'''roduct '''R'''ule; not merely '''a''' product rule.  you'll have to look up the maths conventions, but I'm fairly sure the theorems take a litle \"t\" too.   14:25 19 Jun 2003 (UTC)and where would those be? The science laws seem to frequently be capitalized. It should of course be capitalised. This is yet another of these annoying occasions when wiki seems to have a passionate determination to lowercase things that should be capitalised. It hardly does wiki much credit when the formal name of a rule that as the name of a rule is treated as a proper name is put in wrong. But then most of the political science terms on wiki are in a form that if used by students would see them docked marks, but every effort to correct them on wiki leads to edit wars with the same couple of users who seem to spend their entire time on wiki chanting the mantra \"lower case, lower case, lower case\" . (BTW, Tarquin, you aren't one of them!)  21:15 19 Jun 2003 (UTC)ROFL, good call on the election issues! Are you going to be the official Wikipedia news anchor?   09:33 24 Jun 2003 (UTC) lol I don't think I'd make a terribly NPOV reporter... ) -  09:35 24 Jun 2003 (UTC)Ho ha!

I'd thought it shoudl link to Jacques_Martin_artist as the current JM is not the comic strip artist... Anyway, I'm nto sure how to deal with this so you probably know better D Mark 22:17 GMTI'd just like to go on the record as asking you to please not bite off my scalp. ;)   last new \"paragraph\" in the diff  08:33 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)Hi Tarquin, You edited (M)Talk:Gene Roddenberry, but I can not see any difference. Is this a Wikipedia problem or did you not change anything?  08:25 1 Jul 2003 (UTC) A single apostrophe: \"it's\" -> \"its\". -) (I remember you saying somewhere you're not a native English speaker. The rule, BTW, is that \"it's\" always means \"it is\". It's one of those confusing rules.)   09:41 1 Jul 2003 (UTC) I found it, it was just a comma \",\" too much, sorry for bothering you. It was so small on my screen, I really had to look hard for it ;-)   12:06 1 Jul 2003 (UTC)PS: Many thanks for correcting my errors!I have posted a reply to comments you made on Talk:Dirac delta function. 06:04 4 Jul 2003 (UTC)Hey. Finally answered a comment you left on Talk:DDT back in April. If you're still interested...  00:07 5 Jul 2003 (UTC) thanks. Interesting (and worrying) stuff.   07:42 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)I thought you might be interested in the opinion poll going on now at Talk:Clitoris.   17:52 9 Jul 2003 (UTC)That was pretty rude, deleting a bit of humor from an article that was all fictional and in goodfun!  (oh my, here is someone else's nonsense - we can't have that) 15:29 11 Jul 2003 (UTC) It wasn't funny, and it seemd to me like yet more France-bashing. If the fictional EPA ''within'' the Superman comics has said that, then fine, quote it, but make it clear. If it's just your personal humour, get a room.   16:06 11 Jul 2003 (UTC) France bashing?? please.  I suppose the nose-picking \"humor\" on your page is funnier.  I can take the reasoning behind the \"fictional EPA\" argument which makes sense, but when I see an edit I've made completely  deleted and dismissed with a comment like \"rremove nonsense\", I tend to get a bit irritated.  And now, \"get a room\"; where did THAT come from?  Let's try to leave our personal problems out of the discussion.  16:42 11 Jul 2003 (UTC) The nose-picking stuff on my page is on a user page, not in an article. It's not particularly funny, but I wrote it in response to something that was happening elsewhere on Wikipedia. You would have had to be there. I'm sorry if I offended you, but what contributors personally find funny doesn't belong in the articles.   20:17 11 Jul 2003 (UTC)cool. Hope we can cooperate in the future. 20:21 11 Jul 2003 (UTC)-)   20:41 11 Jul 2003 (UTC)Can you fall in love with a user page?  08:59 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time. ;-)   16:48 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)163.1.242.5 scared me at first, but aren't the redirects harmless?  At that speed I'm fairly sure it was a bot. With our current server problems, we have (AFAIK) a policy that bots MUST be authorized, registered, and drip-feed their edits. (Plus there's the fact that I think the decision on the Manual of style was to encourage uniformity in fate names)  Seems to be continuing under a slightly different IP, probably will be finished in a moment... I think it's a new user that probably hasn't seen the bot policy yet... (Wasn't criticizing blocking, by the way, wondered for a moment whether it was safer to block and ask questions later.) There is a response now at . 10:45, 5 Aug 2003, Tarquin blocked 163.1.242.5 (contribs) (unblock) (are you a bot?)10:52, 5 Aug 2003, Tarquin blocked 163.1.242.101 (contribs) (unblock) (please contact the mailing list)Unblocking these, as he said he would stop, and appears to have a very dynamic ip address anyway. Um, Tarquin, why did you zap my nifty pipe [[Skytrain|SkyTrain]]? I put that in after much thought because although the target ''page'' is called Skytrain and I don't want to rename it until I figure out whether it needs disambiguating or not, the Vancouver system is most definitely SkyTrain capped ''exactly'' like that  Ah. You could make a redirect.  Can you please take a look at my attempts to give a kindergarten English definition of injection, surjection and bijection, as per an earlier poster's request?   it's a good attempt, but I fear that attempts to simplify the language just end up with too many clauses & too many repetitions. I'll mull on this, but I think the simplest explanation may be what we already have, and that the lay reader may be obliged to go read up on the meanings of terms such as 'domain' and 'codomain'.  Well hi...I am a stranger here...albeit noones a stranger but a rich and glorious relation of sorts in a cyber-led multitude where everyone knows ever one else - after a remote-control fashion.

Very much appreciate your thoughtful comments on Talk:Anti-Semitism - I think you've gone quite far to bridging the yawning gap between viewpoints, there!

Just tell me which version you want. For example, \"Judaism 18:46 October 31, 2002\".  22:36 Oct 31, 2002 (UTC)Yah I agree. It would be inappropriate to define the Arawak, above all else, as victims.  15:11 Nov 4, 2002 (UTC)Slr, when you get a chance please take a look at the new entry on Holocaust theology. Don't worry, Slr. Writing the vampirism article is a harmless diversion for Lir, Like Ram-Man playing chess with her. I'll add a few bits about how cannibals ''believe'' they are gaining their enemy's power. I consider the writing of this article a teaching assignment. It's an excellent chance to give Lir (and anyone else watching or helping an in-depth introduction to NPOV. Hi Slru, I doubt that anybody is going to \"rework\" The Wealth on Nations, it was one of the \"works\" by the banned Lir. I put a note on the discussion when i first saw it, then a couple of week later was still the same, so i added the small line telling that was an interpretation. Probably it would have been better to do then what you did now.  12:32 Dec 19, 2002 (UTC)Re: sex  That page is 80% silly editorializing.  Why did you stop ?  216.129.198.41 . Perhaps you should go to talk sex.Hi Slr. I''m not sure I understand why the criticisms were removed in the first place. Because they were inadequate? Because Diamond's supporters have responses? That just seems like a way of stifling an opposing viewpoint. I agree with you that the critique should be included. Careful what version you are editing, otherwise, you are just repeating my editing. I agree-I think for now the focus should not be to add to the article but simply to get what is there properly edited, 172 seems very opposed to compaction howeverHey, Slr. I've been thinking about the problem. There really isn't much that can be done at this stage. In many ways, it's indicative of several problems that have been occurring very frequently in Wikipedia lately. People are assuming ownership of articles, they are assuming authorty over subject matter about which they have have only a perfunctory knowledge, they are confusing the trivial with the essential, they are positing themselves as the central hub of NPOV, any deviation from which is POV, and they are willing to fight to the death for all of the above. Short of getting into a flame war, there isn't much that can be done about it. I think that protecting pages and suggesting bans are radical measures that should be considered carefully before even being suggested. Flame wars only lead to the person with the most persistence winningand cranks are a persistent lot, mostly because they have so much invested in their pet theories. There are so many articles I would love to trash and redo: Israelites, Schneerson, and anything that divides biblical scholarship into maximalist and minimalist camps immediately come to mind. I don't though, not because I can't, but because I haven't got the time or desire to argue with people who are more interested in hearing their own point of view than in really considering its implications or honestly assessing other views. I still plan on redoing large chunks of the Genocide piece, but there too, I'm not willing to get into major battles. Adding a chat room or three would be a good start. Why did you restore the earlier version of the opening paragraph?I did not restore it, I edited it.That earlier version I wrote. I agreed with Vera Cruz with regard to that paragraph.I am glad that you and Vera Cruz agreed.  But Wikipedia is a collective project of evolving articles, and no one owns an article.  Everyone has a right to make edits.Please, before criticizing the article, keep an open mind and read the whole thing. You might have read it a while ago, but it's much improved now.Yes, you are absolutely right here: I shouldn't criticize an article I have not read.  But you are being defensive: I did not criticize the article.  I made a few editorial changes.  Moreover, I made these changes after reading the article.  Moreover, I provided an explanation of these changes.  What else do you want?I wish people would read the whole article before criticizing it and editing it.I do too.  That is why I read it before editing it.  And I haven't criticized it  have I?thank you for you intelligent input on the IPF issue, regardless of where you stand on any particulars. -I responded to your comments on the Bible as history page. Take a look at Israelites, Ancient Israelites, and some of their links for further examples. (This article originally appeared in Israelites and snipped and made an article on its own right). Thanks, Slrubenstein. (re Comments on my user talk page. ) There seems to be general agreement, so I'll make a start on editing New Imperialisim shortly. As regards Guns, Germs and Steel, I suspect that we may, in fact, agree a good deal more than might be plain from the discussion so far. While I think that it is a wonderful book, and certainly believe that it has been an enormously influential one - it must be one of the most-cited works around at present, and forms the basis of any number of tertiary courses - my background in European history/political economy predisposes me to take rather a different aproach to answering Yali's question, one that is more narrowly focussed on the period since, oh, about 1500AD, and relies more on economics, history in the more narrow sense of the word, and above all the changes in the social meaning of things like \"work\" and \"property\" and \"capital\" that led to the Industrial Revolution in Europe, which in turn led to colonisation and the rest of it. I don't think that these views clash to any real extent, however: I see them as complimentary. I will certainly look again at the GG&S; entry, and if no-one else does first, flesh it out and try to make the central thrust of it more plain, but probably not until after re-reading it again in a few months time. (I'm fairly occupied with other things at present and I like to let books settle in my mind for a while before returning to them.) Am I wrong in thinking that there is some confusion as to what has been deleted on the talk:IPF page? At first i thought it might have been vandalism, but then i thought, perhaps JDT got confused as to what was 'archived'. be well. -understood.Hi Sv. The page was full so I trying to move a chunk of stuff to the archival page to make room so I could reply to your last msg. I think you came in in the middle, so when I tried to save it, I was told that someone else had accessed the page and and I was sort of stuck in limbo. Everything moved is in the archives. I don't know what happened over your last bit, because when I finally got in again it was gone. I went back to an earlier version including the bits that went missing and saved that, so everything should now be there. Sorry about that. Don't worry, I wasn't trying to silence you at all. Because I was pressurised into trying to cut a chunk for the archives before someone came in again, I just cut a set number of paragraphs. I didn't have time to read through them and make a 'clean' cut. I hope it still is readable, but all cut stuff is in the archives detailed at the top of the page.JT.Vera Cruz keeps on restoring that redundant version that you reverted.I'm trying to stop him. He's more likely to listen to you though.I have re-written the Irish famine pages, including extensive referencing. (I have even used a major quote which I ''understand'' should be OK. If question-marks do arise over it, I can contact the publishing company  (they are so close I can see their offices from my window as I type this). There is more work to be done on it (some culling and additional info) but this all I am able to do for the present. As you will  see, I have mentioned and contextualised John Mitchel's quote. Let me know what you think of the article if you get the chance.  20:40 Jan 10, 2003 (UTC)Hi Sirub,I'm sorry if you think you have a problem with me. I certainly don't have a problem with you. I have rewritten the famine pages a number of times to include quotes, references suggested by Sv. I know I have been a bit sharp with some people. I have been battling a bad illness for 6 weeks and that has left me bad-tempered, not just on Wiki but in general. I am normally the easiest going person imaginable. But being called a ''tory'', a ''crude revisionist'' & having all Irish opinions dismissed as a British POV would drive most Irish people into a blind fury far stronger than anything I've said. Im only interested in producing a high quality NPOV piece on Wiki. I'm just ignoring Two16. I actually feel sorry for him. I think (quite genuinely) he needs help. But imagine how you would react if a Saddam supporter took over a page on American history,' agendized' it and then accused all Americans unhappy of being ''nazis'' & ''rascists'' and insisted that only ''their'' version (though factually rediculous) was NPOV. It would lead to bitter exchanges. I really am fed up with this row and as I have said, I am simply ignoring Two16 and Sv. Sorry if I offended you, though. You are one of the people (like Mav, Zoe, Camembert, etc) whose opinions I ''do'' take very seriously and respect.  20:26 Jan 19, 2003 (UTC) 20:25 Jan 19, 2003 (UTC)I do agree that Sv and Two16 made some interesting points and I have tried to include it through quotes from John Mitchel and Seamus Metress. I will try to rephrase the point about the differences between the views of the Irish diaspora (specificially Irish America) and local Irish opinion. I guess the point is that whereas in the past Irish history was often agenda-laiden (understandably as Ireland ''used'' its history in the struggle for independence), post-independent Ireland re-evalued its history to separate the agenda-led semi-propaganda (which was notorious in how it appeared in Irish primary (junior) schools until the 1960s) from an accurate factual account, reliant on primary sources. (All states do this when history becomes just that, history, and not something to be ''used'' in a fight for independence.) In particular, during the 150th anniversary, a broad primary-sourced Famine rethink took place. The local Irish view is that whereas their analysis is based on primary sources and not black and white ''goodie'' and ''baddie'' agendas, Irish-America's view is based on folk memory, on images of Ireland ''frozen in time'' and the propaganised history Ireland used in the 1930s.  Seamus Metress reflects this from a different angle, where he thinks such re-analysis is motivated with robbing Ireland of its heroes. Except we view that approach as believing history is about cardboard cutouts of Cuchulainn and Padraig Pearse, singing 'A Nation Once Again' and shouting 'Brits Out' while drunk on guinness. And it irks Ireland when Irish Americans come to Ireland expecting a Brit-hating, guiness-drinking, gaelic speaking, all white conservative catholic state, and find a liberal, gay friendly, Brit-tolerant, budweizer drinking, english-speaking country with motorways, divorce, black-Irish, Chinese Irish and MTV, more likely to be listening to Brittany Spears than singing 'A Nation Once Again'. Many Irish Americans view that Ireland as a ''betrayal'' of the real Ireland that in reality hasn't existed outside New York Irish bars and their 'folk memory' for generations. So we generally see them as living in a gaelic dreamworld of black and white revenge-seeking, stuck in the 1930s (if it existed even then!); they see us as betraying our history, culture & identity. That is the crux of the problem. (I've cut out some of my earlier comments to make room, as my browser is limiting my space to write here. Hope that is OK with you!)  22:29 Jan 19, 2003 (UTC)SIrub, just read your experience with Two16 on the Revolution page. Scary, man! So obviously I'm not alone having the ''Two16 Experience''. (Poor Mav is getting a rough time from him now because he sought to defend me on the Famine page.)  04:29 Jan 20, 2003 (UTC)I wish to apoligize for primarily describing the Arawak as victims. As I would like to add some information on Salim I al Sabah, Kabbar, Abdul Aziz ibn Abdul Rahman ibn Saud, Najd, Faisal I, Political Titles of the Ottoman Empire, Warba, Abdulla II al Sabah, the First Kuwaiti Crisis, Abdullah ibn Hussein, Mashian, Failakah, Auhah, al Khalifa, al Jalahima, al Sabah, Abdul Karim Qasim, Jaber III al Ahmad al Sabah, Muhammad I al Sabah, the Second Kuwaiti Crisis, Zaki Arsuzi, Salah al Din Bitar, Ghazi ibn Faisal, Bakr Sidqi, Abdullah II al Sabah, Ahmad al Sabah, Abdul Ilah, and Percy Cox, as well as (obviously) the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of October 1922, the Turkish Petroleum Company, the Basra-Baghdad Highway, the Berlin-Baghdad Railroad, and the Abudllah Khor Waterway, Nuri al Said, Abdulla III al Sabah, Aramco, the Kuwait Oil Company, and the Anglo-Kuwaiti Treaty of 1899; I would like to inquire as to what objections you might have to my doing so? Hi VC  I had no idea it was you who characterized the Arawakans primarily as victims (I thought that was Lir).  In any event, do not apologize to me, if you have regrets, apologize to them.  Why do you bring this up now?  The last time I looked at the Arawakan article was in November 2001 and at tha time it looked fine.  As for all the other articles to which you would like to contribute, it is not for me to say whether you contribute or not  and frankly I do not care whether you or anyone does contribute.  I will as always look at articles on topics I am interested in or knowledgable about, and continue to make suggestions when I see problems with the atyle or content  which is what I think all of us are doing, right? The aspect of banning people disturbs me somewhat, especially colorful people with a valid history of contribution. This is especially so in a system where the rules are a bit amorphous to begin with. SL, you often show a humility and intelligence that are both ''shin'' (han) and insightful, and for you to admit a mistake of prejudice; \"I thought that was Lir\", is evidence of the quality of this community and its future as a repository of widely accepted substance.Let me add: If we apply the analogy of the cockroach law ( ''1 on the kitchen floor means 50,000 in the walls'' ) to this, how many ''misconceptions'' does a community operate under in any frame of time? -Hmmmm.  I am not sure I follow Sv's comment.  First, the reason I thought that the person who identified Awarwakans primarily as Lir is because according to the history of that article, it was Lir who wrote the section I had been refering to (and, after I made my comment on the talk page, it was Lir who made the appropriate revision).  Second, I really do not care who wrote it, or who revised it  there was problematic text, I made a comment, someone revised it.  It doesn't really matter to me whether Lir or VC wrote the offensive (in my opinion) passage, or whether it was Lir or VC who revised it to its current (and, again in my opinion, improved) state.  Sv, I genuinely appreciate your compliment, but although I might be disappointing you, I wasn't apologizing because in this particular instance I did not, and do not, think thee is anything for me to apologize about.  I was really just expressing my surprise that VC was refering to the Arawakans, given the history of that page.  Third, I do not understand why Sv is bringing up the issue of banning.  I have never suggested that anyone be banned, and as I am not a sysop I have never banned anyone myself. Well, Im not going to take back the compliment either way. - p.s. I was simply expanding on a point you made, SL, not saying ''you'' were advocating anything.Got it!  I may be slow, but in the end I will always accept a compliment, I kind of like the mapping analogy in genetic code, and I think with a bit of tweaking that first paragraph could be good. The rest of it explaining about codons and so on (the part I wrote) still needs a lot of work, though... The problem I keep running into is how to avoid a didactic tone, which helps get the point across better, but doesn't seem sufficiently \"encyclopedic\" to me.I envy you the VC post, by the way. I’ve been busy lately, but look forward to making further contributions. I’m looking forward to working with you on that history of capitalism article.It’s a massive endeavor, so I’ve been compiling some of my old articles (don’t worry, they’re not copyrighted).Britannica has a good article on economic systems. An ideal article for Wikipedia would be a sort of abridgement of an article that detailed.Hey, Slr! You been busy! Okay, I stand by my contention, btw. Do you disagree? Inquiring minds wanna know? Hey, Slr! - Im about to dump a fresh version of idolatry into the databaste, Im wondering if you can take a look at it. Gracias, Lunch - bbl.Thanks -All I know is that RK reverted my edits and nobody cared. And now, days later, you are asking him about changing something which I had attempted to change earlier. It would be nice if there was some more effective communication regarding editing.RK is carrying on a campaign against me based purely on personal issues, that is unacceptable. Fiction to fact? Indeed, you ''are'' attached to your idols of static concepts, and disconnected, defined, and dictated terms. -\"I think you are projecting! I am attached to my own desire to understand how other people use their concepts. Thus, when asked about something like psychological theories into \"attachment,\" I try to find out how psychologists use the term (and why). I guess one thing I am not attached to is my own navel! ;)\" SlrubensteinWell, projecting or not, Im pleased you can admit to a bias toward the standard and banal, even if it is the lovely subject of the brain. Im disappointed that your imagination couldnt ''handle'' the notion that being attached to something flows into the idea of holding thins up as idols. Symbols are a corrolary - making these static denies the value of the symbol to work its magic in the human imagination. Not to mention the ''wacky'' idea that attachment might mean something more than just, well... (despite its debunking-ness)  Freudian .)  Tie things together Stanley. -Ah, youre weight was due to your attachment to your ''\"concerns\"'', causing you to dismiss the point altoghether. The ''interesting'' part of your statement dealt with the perhaps inadvertently implied notion that my explaining a connection between these, somehow made static the concept itself, which is still utter nonsense. Perhaps ''attributable'' nonsense, but nonetheless baseless. Im not denying that your contribution was valid; its not easy to retype and reword a whole page of text out of a psych journal - but it does need some color, as Im sure you agree. ;) -Of all of that I have no doubt. It certainly takes every kind of people to make what life's about. -I apologise. I am in one of my very sarcastic moods (well my computer did start to playing John Denver singing ''Take Me Home, Country Road'' and a man has got to react ''somehow''!!!). I should not have said it and I apologise. I simply do not understand what the problem is putting standard christological images with deliberately NPOV descriptions that make no theological claims whatsoever onto a page on christ. Only two of the images are in any way denominational, and that they are denominational is clearly explained in the captions. The other images are of agreed aspects of Christ's life and death are used by billions, across the denominations with no problem. (One of the images I received on two christmas cards last year, one from a Southern Baptist from Memphis, the other a Lutheran in Frankfurt.) They need no description, no definition, no exhaustive paragraphs of art analysis, simply a one line caption saying what are. It is frankly incredible that any publication that can include pictures should choose not to, and be dogmatic about not doing so, in an article about ''the'' most illustrated figure on history, dreaming up all sorts of dubious arguments about hidden POV, about supposedly required explanations forn any art included. You are not talking about pictures that are POV here, to be analysed in 15 paragraphs and 18 links. You are simply taking about a couple of standard bog-ordinary illustrations, used by many denominations, and put in to improve the visual appeal of the badly laid out, convulated page. Sometimes people on wiki seem to forget that if you want people to use a page, you do need to make it visually appealing. And the more complex the page content, the more you need to add in 'visual breaks' (ie graphics, headings, quotes, etc). That is all those pictures do, and they made a ''very'' badly structured page in terms of layout and communication, more visually appealing, which is the sole reason they were put there originally. Sorry if I sound a bit dogmatic or rude; I am not trying to be. But while wiki can be a great source to worth with, sometimes it becomes like a bizarre monty pythonesque joke and having to state the bleeding obvious is getting to be annoying, Or maybe it is just that as a writer and someone who has worked in graphic design and page layout I can see the obvious, whereas people who haven't dont.  05:47 Mar 25, 2003 (UTC)\n",

I can't speak for the acuracy of those examples, though.Is \"newspeak\" the right word for this? It may be misguided romantic nationalism, but it is hardly Orwellian thought control. Maybe \"Croat and Bosnian neologisms\" would be better. -  01:35, Sep 23, 2003 (UTC) It is true indeed, I expected a reaction but what I did not expect was that these guys would first off all hijack my article, erase my own contribution and turn into another one of their senseless idiocies, just type in the words in a search engine and see if they are but a mere product of my imagination or not.   23:02, Sep 27, 2003 (UTC) inappropriate comments moved to Igor, you are such a mindless troll. This time not only did you pull another chauvinistic pan-Serb attempt to poke fun at non-Serbs, but you also majorly screwed up: if you had any clue whatsoever, you wouldn't include the word \"pantalone\" in any sort of text that pretends to be Croatian. Otherwise, the Croatian section is simply wrong  most those words are a pure and simple joke (by Croats!), while some are a silly product of a playful mind, some even pre-20th century. In any event, they are most definitely not officially used.If anyone does use some of it, it's not people with authority over language issues.Ditto for the Bosnian section. The words other than kahva are from jokes, and as for that one, Bosniaks have used words with more \"h\" sounds than in other dialects probably much before this little troll was even born.I implore the senior Wikipedians to do something about this person who is seriously bigoted, hateful and doesn't contribute much other than his jingoist point of view to the database  at times continuously, since lately I seem to tend to spend a lot of time repeatedly cleaning up his derisory outbursts. 16:16, 23 Sep 2003 (UTC)Based only on the article, and what I read here, I attempted a vague NPOV approach. However, this stuff really should be merged and redirected with Croatian language and Bosnian language, and dealt with there. IMO.  18:41, 23 Sep 2003 (UTC) inappropriate comments moved to  This is not really an issue that needs a neutral point of view, it needs a simple grasp of actual facts rather than a nebulous flamebait. Thanks for removing most of the junk from the page, but stating how Bosniaks only now started including Turkish words in their language is pan-Serbism as well: they have used a lot of words similar to Turkish or Arabic ever since the Ottoman Empire had control over Bosnia, several hundreds of years ago. It all goes hand in hand with extreme nationalist Serb claims that there is no such ethnicity or language as Bosniak or Bosnian (resp.). I guess you can see these claims as just another POV, but if the vast majority of Bosnian Muslims say they're Bosniaks and speak Bosnian (and that's over two million people), I don't see much reason for discussion. If someone wishes to explain the tangentially related coinage increase in per-language pages, please go ahead. However, nonsense that is presented in the title and the original page can never become an encyclopedic article and should be dealt away with. Pending further discussion, I intend to propose the deletion of this page.  13:40, 24 Sep 2003 (UTC)Be as it may, I have deleted the link on Bosnian language page. Also-I've deleted the content since it's false. Croatian tradition of linguistic purism has been in vigorous existence for more than 5 centuries-and has nothing to with Serbian language as such. Better- forced serbianization (luckily, unsuccessful) of Croatian language was evident in attempts to suppress this purist tradition and to rely entirely on loan-words (Serbian language characteristics), rather than calques or words created by rules of Croatian word-formation. Bosnian language has no such characteristic (apart from Islamic oriental loan-words- which is anything but linguistic purism). The material on the page will be added later. inappropriate comments moved to I've edited the page & written the text. Well- Mr. Igor something is free to write whatever he deems appropriate on his fantasies-but not to interfere with the text I wrote. No NPOVs or similar manoeuvres which would have diluted the text and made it unreadable and impossible to follow the narrative. He may write his version-but that's all. In other case- the entire page should be deleted.Shame this has developed into such an invictive. The page is a little provocative, and needs some NPOVing, but hardline Croats did launch a campaign of neologisms, and there was a lot of pressure, particularly in areas like the Krajina and ES to be 'the most Croatian' and increase the degree of separation of the languages. For the most part it was a part of post-war Croatia coming to terms with the death of Yugoslavia, and most of the examples listed did not take on - they are funny in retrospect, but the Tudjman govt did try to do this, and many of these examples were introduced as words by the govt.Let's see this little political missive.Shame this has developed into such an invictive. The page is a little provocative, and needs some NPOVing, but hardline Croats did launch a campaign of neologismsCroats did not \"launch a campaign of neologisms\" (btw- what a Stalinist lingo. What's next ? Some cabal of Croatian linguists ?): it's the genuine feature of Croatian language. Croatian linguistic purism, and there was a lot of pressure, particularly in areas like the Krajina and ES to be 'the most Croatian' and increase the degree of separation of the languages.There was never \"Krajina\" or \"ES\"- save a temporary occupied Croatian territory, during which \"Yugoslav People's Army\" (spit) (mis)used Serbian fifth column in Croatia-much like Hitler Germans in Sudetenland and Silesia. With known result.For the most part it was a part of post-war Croatia coming to terms with the death of Yugoslavia, and most of the examples listed did not take on - they are funny in retrospect, but the Tudjman govt did try to do this, and many of these examples were introduced as words by the govt. inappropriate comments moved to I don't really know what to say about your response, I don't feel that the references to Stalin or Hitler are entirely justified. Yes, there is an absense of linguistic information, because this is, essentially, a political, rather than a linguistic issue. My central point, and, I think, what you are disagreeing with, is that, after Croatia gained its independence, a group of Croatian politicians attempted to introduce new words into the language in order to distinguish it further from 'Serbian' or 'Bosnian'.As to whether there ever was a Krajina or ES, I don't think that this is the place for that argument.OK, for the sake of \"peace\" I'll leave a puppet-statelet on Serbia's infusion out of debate. Here is the quote: \"My central point, and, I think, what you are disagreeing with, is that, after Croatia gained its independence, a group of Croatian politicians attempted to introduce new words into the language in order to distinguish it further from 'Serbian' or 'Bosnian'.\"Nice. Name them. C'mon. Vice Vukojevic, for one. A parliamentary deputy (Croatian Democratic Community) proposed two draft bills on language in 1995; in summary he wanted the phonetic alphabet be replaced by an etymological one and that many words be purged from the language as non-Croatian. The other draft bill he introduced was to establishing a Government Office for Croatian Language, which would have a police function, with anyone found breaking the new language rules being fined or even imprisoned. Both of these bills were rejected by the parliament, while the independent media and some of the top Croatian linguists regarded the proposals as outrageous. see NOVI LIST, vol. 49, no. 141, 26 May 1995 for a Bosnian equivalent see S.

Upper Silesia is divided into 2 Polish provinces, Silesian Voivodship (capital Katowice) and Opole Voivodship (capital Opole), and one Czech province, the Silesian-Moravian Region (capital Ostrava). Lower Silesia is divided into 2 Polish provinces, Lower Silesian Voivodship (capital Wroclaw) and partly Lubusz Voivodship (capital Zielona Gora).  Because of its rich history the region has produced a unique cultural mix based on the local Silesian elements with strong Polish, Czech and German influences. Today the region is inhabited by Poles, Silesians, Germans, Czechs and Moravians. History of Silesia is connected with history of the four nations and countries: Poland, Bohemia and Germany.  In the middle ages Silesia was an object of Polish-Czech rivalry but also with many ethnic Germans settling here. It was a province of the Bohemian Kingdom from 1348 to 1742, although a small portion became Polish in 1443. In 1742-1763 most of Silesia was seized by Prussia in the Silesian Wars, and organized into the Prussian provinces Upper and Lower Silesia until 1945. After World War I half of Upper Silesia, and after WWII most of Silesia was ceded to Poland. During WWII all of Silesia was part of Nazi Germany and the Germans murdered or expelled most Poles and Jews (see concentration camps, Auschwitz-Birkenau, Gross-Rosen); after WWII most of the Germans were expelled from Poland and Czechoslovakia (Expulsion of the Germans).I would agree to that. We have also to convince others, and wait a while for the comments and maybe some improvements Is it OK to say History of Silesia is connected with history of the '''four nations''' and countries: Poland, Czechia(Bohemia), Germany and Austria.Lubusz voivodship is not currently considered part of Silesia, but an entity on its own. There is a reason why people were demonstrating for one Lubuskie voivodship and screaming we are not Poznaniaks, but Lubuszans.Second, I don't think that intro is good. Tired of explaining why, though.Third, FIVE nations: Hungary was involved (temporarily) in SIlesia too (Mathias COrvinus). Or SIX if countinng Moravia. Or SEVEN if counting PRUSSIA (after all, if separately Austria and Germany, then why not split Germany later. Mentioning Austria and Germany in pre-XIX century context is IMHO absurd) Germany and Austria - OK, I have returned to the version agreed by my and Wik.Three books in my possession show maps and texts claiming that south portion of Lubuskie is part of Silesia today: Stefan Mizia, ''Historia Śląska. Popularny zarys dziejów'', Wydawnictwo Rzeka, Wrocław 2000 Lech Szafraniec, ''Śląsk Dolny, Górny, Opawski'', (no date/publisher) ''Śląsk'', in: Encyklopedia Historii Gospodarczej Polski'', Warszawa 1980Caius2ga, the first paragraph of your proposed version is fine with me, although I know others strongly object to your characterization of Silesian as a separate language.  The second paragraph is almost completely uninformative.  The third paragraph has some significant problems: 1) the Austrian connection before 1742 ought to be specifically mentioned.  2) Silesia was not seized in the Silesian Wars between 1742 and 1763.  In the first place, the First Silesian War started in 1740, and ended in 1742.  In the second place, so far as I know, the Austrians after 1742 retained the exact same territories in the 1745 and 1763 treaties.  Reed Browning in ''The War of the Austrian Succession'' says of the Treaty of Dresden (1745): \"Austria retained, as it had in 1742, Cesky Tesin and Opava.\"  This suggests that all of the seizing had already been completed by 1742, and that the 1744-45 and 1756-63 wars were Austrian attempts to regain already lost territories, rather than further seizures by Prussia.  Thirdly, thediscussion of Nazi horrors is absolutely unnecessary in the introductory paragraph, especially since it is not particularly specific to Silesia.  And the last sentence is silly - shouldn't we be discussing the expulsion of Germans ''from Silesia'', not from Poland and Czechoslovakia as a whole?In terms of the alternative proposal, it's definitely better, although I think ''some'' indication of the ethnic status of the province and the ethnic transfers after World War II is in order, as also, perhaps, the fact that part of Upper Silesia went to Poland after World War I... If discussion of Nazi horrors is unnecessary, then so is the discussion of expulsions. Neither was specific to Silesia.  I agree with Wik. The expulsions should be moved to the history section. The expulsions permanently changed the ethnic composition of Silesia.  Nazi atrocities, while pronounced in formerly Polish Upper Silesia, were not there any different from those throughout central-Eastern Europe, and do not provide any information necessary to understand the history of Silesia.  The expulsions do. \n",

            "I would like to suggest a few rules in using the two competing character sets:After a Chinese term is inserted in the article, latecomers could not rewrite the term using different character set.  Except personal names.Chinese names for people and place in Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong should be written in traditional characters.Chinese names for people and place in Singapore or mainland China should be written in simplifed characters.Chinese names for ancient Chinese should better be written in traditional characters.  Personally I think it is more respectful, especially traditional characters are still in use.  I would not ask the names of person in state of Han to be written in characters of Han, of course.Chinese names for overseas Chinese could be in any character sets.  Rule #1 should apply, unless the person himself or his closed relatives or friends ask for a change.  The dichotomy of \"Modern Mainland\" / \"traditional China, and Taiwan/HK/Macau\" should extend from persons to non-persons, such as concepts (Tao) and objects (sheng), as well. Addition to # 5, those oversea Chinese who left China before the character simplification, as most on the List of famous Chinese Americans did, should be written in Traditional Chinese. I am not entirely agree at all to this proposal. Both Traditional and Simplified Chinese are in signifcant use. I would sugguest one simple rule without worrying about what kind of respects or timing for either parties of Chinese character users: Incorporates both form of Chinese characters at all time. I think we ought to provide both, if applicable. This is related to the List of Chinese proverbs article. The only reason why I changed the entirety of the Mandarin proverbs to the Simplified set is just that: Speakers of Mandarin will have a high enough chance of understanding the Simplified characters whereas their Traditional counterparts may not be as familiar. While the majority of schoolchildren educated in the Mainland will learn to read Traditional proficiently, they are nonetheless native to the Simplified set, so hence the change. But hey, if you want to reference the Traditional characters alongside the Simplified ones (or vice versa), then more power to you. -Wait...do you mean the other way around? Didnt you changed simplified to traditional?  01:37, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)Yes, a user was suggesting that because Traditional is older in usage than Simplified, changing Simplified to Traditional for the Mandarin subsection somehow \"violated\" the basic rules governing the Chinese language. I was merely trying to point out that a high percentage of people educated in China (regardless of whether or not they're from the Mainland or Taiwan, etc.) will understand both sets of characters. I do, and I immigrated to the US after finishing the fourth grade (not a generalization). -There are a couple of questions involved here: (1) Are native speakers of Chinese educated using traditional Chinese comfortable reading simplified characters, and vice-versa. (2) Is any information lost if a text is translated from traditional to simplified?  I think the answeer to (1) is that there is a significant number of people from both groups who are not comfortable with the other writing system. And the answer to (2) is yes. There are a fairly large number of many-to-one mappings going from traditional to simplified. There is no good way to do the one-to-many mappings that happen in going from simplified to traditional. The free Macintosh software gives you a way to select alternatives, but only on a non-global basis (fixing them one by one). On the Windows side, one can buy NJStar and try its artificial intelligence feature to make the translation.I think the ideal would be to compose in traditional, translate to simplified, and then make both versions available. One way would be to have a link to separate versions of the text in the article on, e.g., Chinese poems. That way both versions of the text will be correct.The purpose of the encyclopedia is to make information readily available, and that means that it is best to avoid creating barriers when the costs are only a couple minutes extra effort. 02:26, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)Thanks for your input. While I do agree that a certain gap exists between users of the two character sets, I have personally gone through the converted text to insure against ambiguities and erroneous character usage. And, as with most idioms, a bit of guesswork may be involved. -We should accomodate '''everyone''' and use both character sets. Could you please add back the traditional? Even if traditional readers can somehow decipher simplified, some may find the communist font repulsive.  04:50, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)To associate a language with mere politics is the greatest travesty of language-kind. I really have nothing against either of the systems; in fact, I do think that Traditional is much more refined though Simplified also has its positive points. It's just a matter of practicality. -''What should be'' is irrelevant here. We should look at ''what is''. There's no use escaping the truth of things.  17:28, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)Very well. What is relevant here is that principle dialect of the Mainland, Guoyu or Putonghua, corresponds to the Simplified set. That's it. Again, I have absolutely no objections and grievances if the articles were to contain Traditional and Simplified simultaneously, but to say that one system takes precendence when being read by a mixed audience is absurd. -Yes, both systems should be included. That also means that simplified should not take precedence even though more people use it. Agreed. Glad to have come to a mutual understanding on this topic. -I agree that we should accomodate everyone. Also, it should be noted that is can be extremely difficult for someone who is accustomed to simplified characters to realize that s/he is writing a simplified character, and that the character written written may have, as a traditional form, an entirely different meaning. (It's like using \"4\" as the equivalent of \"for\", writing \"5 4 2 dollars\" and having somebody who treats these symbols at their original meaning interpreting it not to mean \"5 for 2 dollars\" but as \"542 dollars\".) The character formed by xin1 (heart) and jing1 (capital) is a traditional Chinese character pronounced liang2 and meaning sorrowful. But in simplified Chinese it means \"to be startled.\" It would be easy to fail to see the need to rewrite this character, but a planned substitution table like the one included in NJStar would take care of it automatically. 06:12, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)Sorry, but I am not familiar with the Traditional character from your description. Do you mean 哀 (ai2), sorrowful, or 椋 (liang2), a type of bird? There is also an obscure character which combines vehicle and capital, though its meaning is not sorrowful but rather some ancient cart. Just a query. -No. It is the same character that is used in simplified Chinese for \"chi1 jing1 de jing1\". It combines the \"standing heart radical\" with \"jing1\" as in \"Bei3 Jing1\". 15:39, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)Could you provide an example as to the usage of the Traditional form? I have never used nor have seen usage of Jing1 outside of the context of being startled, as in 惊天动地, 惊人之举, or 惊涛骇浪, all having more or less the same meaning of fear and the instillment thereof. ''Actually, I suppose liang2, that is, water (or ice in Simplified) radical + jing1 could be used for sorrow... -If you have only seen it in those contexts it must mean that you have only seen it being borrowed to use as a simplified character (it served as a traditional simplified character before it was made official by the PRC). Pronounced liang2 or liang4 it is entry 10980 in the Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chiense Language, Zhong1 Wen2 Da4 Ci2 Dian3.  A more ordinary example would be writing \"good elephant\" for \"seems to be\" not realizing that the first xiang4 is not the same as the second one in traditional Chinese. 16:01, 6 Sep 2003 (UTC)Actually, Xiang4 as in Haoxiang, Xiangpian, and etc. is written in Simplified with 像 (danren pang + xiang). Furthermore, 象 can also be used in both Simplified and Traditional to mean a likeness or a symbol (as you would imagine, the striking image of a large mammal is used to exemplify something that is concretely visible). About the liang2 variant character, I have inquired as to such a character with my cousin who attends Beijing Daxue in the Mainland, and he has, in turn, contacted a member of the faculty as to this dilemma. As of now, I am awaiting his response. In the mean time, I have also consulted the《词海》and the《新华词典》at the library and neither has given mention to this character in the context which you have described. I would be very grateful if you could provide me with the usage of the character in a sentence, though a phrase containing the character would suffice just as well. ''Actually, is this character province or ROC-specific? Both the ROC and several nonautonomous regions of the PRC use variant characters not normally found in Mandarin.''  -The word as I have explained it above is also given in the Kang Xi Zi Dian  which was written a long time before there was ever a ROC/PRC split.Mainland dictionaries such as the Xiandai Han Ying Cidian give the \"elephant\" form, not the other one in \"hao3 xiang4.\" Is the old version of this character creeping back in? Or have lexicographers been writing the \"wrong\" one in their dictionaries?The example of liang2 > jing1 that I used is not a particularly good one, just the first one that came to mind. Like the zhe4 in zhe4 bian1, you probably will not find it used in its original meaning during recent centuries.On the other hand, the yuan4 written in simplified yuan4 yi4 (willing to) is still in use as a traditional character. The traditional character written with yuan2 (origin) over xin1 (heart) means \"honest\", \"sincere\", not \"willing to.\"I don't think there is anything wrong with simplifying characters. Almost everybody does it.  Who writes the old (\"correct\") form of cai2 meaning \"only then\" instead of substituting the cai2 that means \"talent\" any more?The real problem for ensuring meaningful communications comes when there are many-to-one mappings when going from traditional to simplified and then a messy one-to-many mapping when going back from simplified to traditional. 02:46, 7 Sep 2003 (UTC)As a Chinese educated, I don't have any problem with any of the two versions. As far as wikipedian articles are concerned, '''both forms''' have to be entered at all times, especially if the '''original meaning''' is lost in the mappings.I quite agree.If I were running a political campaign and I wanted to appeal to Hispanic and Anglo voters, I would not restrict myself to writing in Spanish, in English, and certainly not in Esperanto either. I would want to communicate my ideas in such a way that all the people whose thinking I wanted to influence could understand me. If I wanted to be language-nationalistic I would write in Gaelic  but in the U.S. who would bother to decipher what I had written? (Besides I'd have to hire a translator as I can't speak it either.) So why would anybody writing in Chinese want to freeze out one or another language community? There would actually be a point in writing versions in HK extra hanzi, Taiwanese in traditional characters sprinkled with roman letters to represent sounds for Taiwanese words that don't have characters... But when we are writing a page intended for people whose mother tongue is English, then I think the intention should be to provide them with help. I doubt that many Anglo types would benefit much from character texts tailored for speakers of min2 bei3 hua4.Here are some more cases where currently valid traditional characters are used as simplified characters standing for entirely different words/meanings:Àëëx?0„2  li2: Bright, elegant; to oppose. becomes li2: to separate from?? chong1 tender, delicate becomes zhong3: sort, kind, variety?? yao1: small, tender becomes me0: ending for she2me, etc.?? pi1 or pei1: unfired bricks becomes huai4: bad.?? zhu4: space between the throne and the \"green room\" behind it becomes ning2: peaceful(Are there instructions somewhere on how to convert big5 to the &xxxx; format?

It is unrelated to which version sells more, nor which one is understandable by more people.  When you don't know T. Chinese, no one will blame you for using S. Chinese.  But overwritting T. Chinese with S. Chinese is a disrespect to the Chinese Language.  I totally agree with the Wiki guideline.  Use both because either one can please two group of audience.  01:26, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)So you're saying that people uninterested in Shakespeare (and who have not been \"forced\" in reading his plays) will voluntarily go out and purchase Cliff's Notes and thusly increase the sales of such texts to greater amounts than that of Shakespeare's works? -Don't bring unrelated topics into this argument. You know as well as I do that the characters (be it Traditional '''or''' Simplified) inherantly possess the same, unaltered meaning regardless of the number of strokes. Unless of course you're talking about calligraphy, in which case I'll agree with you that replacing complex Traditional characters with obscene markings is a crime to the language and its people. Using an updated system in lieu of an older  albeit identical in usage and in meaning  system does not have the equivalent of paraphrasing or watering down the ultimate point which it is trying to convey. -Hey, I have an idea. I'll present you with several archaic markings from the Jiaguwen period and you tell me whether or not the usage of Traditional today is the '''ultimate''' affront to \"real\" Chinese writing. -Modern English and Shakespearean English conveys the same meaning too, but the Cliff's Notes can never be a substitute for the real thing.   01:46, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)No kidding. But I'll present you now with the following two sets of characters, one in Traditional and one in Simplified, and, if you can find even an ounce of difference between the actual meanings of the two, then kindly point it out and I'll digress:想要掩盖事实，反而更加暴露。想要掩蓋事實，反而更加暴露。Why don't you quote some other text where several Traditional Chinese characters are folding into the same character.  E.g. Fa (as in hair, emit), Gan (as in dry, work, tree truck, intervene), Mian (as in noodle, face), Hou (as in after and queen), Li (as in lane and inside), Zhou (as in the surname and edge) or Jing (as in trait, quest). Each of these examples must be resolved in context for S. Chinese, while the T. Chinese are clear.I've already explained this in Simplified characters. It is the process by which needlessly redundant characters are conflated to alleviate the hardships of learning rarely used variant characters. Are you aware that in the Chinese lexicon, long before the Traditional system was conceived, there existed hundreds of thousands of characters and variations thereof? The relationship of 字 versus 词 is greatly emphasized in the language, with modern \"words\" being formed out of characters that are thousands of years old. Notwithstanding, there are only a handful of characters which have been conflated in Simplified, and even then the likelihood of confusing one 词 for another (given the context) is rare. -Please do not confuse the two matters. We are talking about if it is a proper behaviour to change character sets in a well-written article, not about which character set is supreme. My point of view is, the choice of the character set comes to the first one who added a Chinese term. Since most Chinese are able to real BOTH character sets, it is not necessary to convert one character set to the other or we will face needless argument-like what we have here!(Oh, Toaster, this paragraph is by me, not the guy above P - 17:14, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC))Toaster?! P -Oh sorry! Too hungry! P  19:57, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)It would appear that you are the one propagating character supremacy here; is that '''not''' the thesis in your original article in which that you seem to think that the use of anything other than Traditional is \"a disrespect to the Chinese language\"? Those are your words, not mine. Furthermore, unless you are completely misreading my responses, my only reason for altering the Mandarin portion was for '''clarification''' and not some sort of a clandestine initiative to establish a \"super race\" among Chinese characters! -Putting names in two character sets side by side is better. But for long phrases, it is too cumbersome to me. Tell that to the guy above, whose responses are becoming more and more overloaded with hypocrisy. -\"The guy above\" is back, but not for long.  It is amazing that so much has gone on in my absence.  In my opinion, Taoster is subconsciously struggling with the \"superior\" Chinese characters himself and as a result he is slamming his judgement and interpretation on my comments.  I never said Traditional Chinese is superior to Simplied Chinese.  Say, if you paint the White House pink because you believe pink is a more popular color, then when I complain about your action, it DOES NOT mean I think White is a superior color.  I am getting tired of this debate, it is getting nowhere.  Since this a public forum, I voiced my opinion for all other to hear.  Hypocrisy or not is upto individuals to interprete.  If Taoster didn't hear the message because he is too obsessed with his S. Chinese, so be it.  What do I get if I win the debate?  Why should I care?  But Wikipedia loses when a more precise information (in this case the text) is reduced to a lesser representation.The argument about S.Chinese and T.Chinese carried the same meaning and hence it is okay to substitute one with the other is lame and ridiculous.  I have seen many books published in China that are in romanized pinyin.  Each romanized pinyin character and phrase carries the same meaning as the S.Chinese counterpart.  Per Taoster's argument, we can abandon all Chinese writings because romanized pinyin can do the same job.  That will be my last words on this topic.  Signing off...  22:23, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)Your comments really seem to be both self-serving and self-defeating at the same time. While you ended your last message with the all-too-common \"This is my last stab at the topic and I won't be returning because my ego has been depleted\" clincher, what are the odds that you are reading this '''right now'''? Furthermore, I would to make it clear for the record of what you stated (quite angrily and determined, I might add) a couple of messages prior this one: ''But overwritting T. Chinese with S. Chinese is a disrespect to the Chinese Language''  How can you justify further your disclaim of having said something '''when it is clearly right before your very eyes'''?. Do you understand that disrespect is synonymous with insultation?And now you're bringing in Pinyin to salvage what little bits and pieces of an argument you may still have. As it stands, you '''still have not''' responded to my query as to whether or not any information was lost in the given example when trasitioned between the two character sets. Here's some advice: take a position and stick to it, and stop hiding behind your cowardly mask of anonymity.-In my opinions, overwriting one character set with another is a bad idea, it could be a disrepect to the first writer. That's all I want to say. - 23:33, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)As I have been reminded time and again by , \"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, then don't submit it here.\" Does writing apply solely to the written word and not characters? -Don't you think that it would be silly if I prefer \"color\" to \"colour\" and so I change every \"colour\" in Wikipedia to \"color\"?  If you really modify my writing then I will not complain, but if you simply replace my writing with \"identical one\" then it is not a real edit in my mind and I certainly object.  I will not start an edit war because of that but I surely feel bad about it.  01:00, 5 Sep 2003 (UTC)What good is an article if no one can understand it? The purpose of Wikipedia is to convey knowledge; a contributor's main duty is to provide approachable and understandable texts for whomever may wish to benefit from them. And the last time I checked, most Mainlanders were quite capable of reading Simplified, and most institutions of higher learning here in the US teach the Simplified set. Why do you think I edited only the Mandarin subsection? -Not only mandarin speakers will be interested in the mandarin proverbs. That assumption should not be made. Then how about the Taiwanese, Hongkongers and many old oversea Chinese?  Well, that means we have to made two character sets side by side then.  04:55, 5 Sep 2003 (UTC)I think we should anglicize Oriental names and list them accordingly. If the family name is Woo and the first name Shino; then we should write Shino Woo; not Woo Shino. This is the English wikipedia and we need to treat all names similarily; regardless of origin. \n",

Like, 5 months ago. But now I have come to see the beauty of WikiWays. I now embrace WikiCulture, with its excessive linking (which is called \"wikification\", by the way), edit conflicts and that ruling elite that's never around when you need them. Take comfort in the fact that Wikipedia is not the most heavily linked website on the Internet  I once saw a dictionary where every word was a link to the other dictionary entries.   04:45 Apr 22, 2003 (UTC)Shino, what you say above is just plain common sense. Alas, some fool will come along and put links around every date and word in sight, sooner or later. The Wiki policy is to only link relevant things, but somehow it's much easier to ''add'' a doubtful link than it is to ''remove'' one. So our articles wind up being over-linked most of the time.  Actually, I'd link years in the above list (thus proving Tannin's point about fools... ;-). Reader \"story\" to justify it - Alice, a girl of just 14, reads the article on gun control. She's not a lawyer (though she will grow up to be a specialist in international law), and doesn't particularly want to get into legal nitty gritty, so the link to Gun Control Act looks uninviting. But Alice wonders \"what was 1968 like? What kind of society was it that decided that guns needed control. So she clicks on the 1968 link and finds... well, probably a large collection of random links, but ideally she'd find an overview of that year. The \"problems\" with overlinking are the underlines, which impair speedreading. The solution is to change the stylesheet so that links are a different colour, but not underlined. They can go underlined on mouseover. You can set in the preferences whether you want links underlined or not. -  20:40 Apr 22, 2003 (UTC)As a beast radiating in curiosity, I love clicking on what seem like meaningless links. Once you get there, you're off on some exploration. You chance upon something, and your knowledge changes. Regulations are in place that weed out the ''useless'' articles; therefore, ideally, all articles in wikipedia are ''useful''; therefore, there can be no ''useless'' links. All wiki-links link to something ''useful''. Part of what makes wikipedia so fantastic is ability to explore, to make connections. Personally, the more wiki-links within an article, the better, because (ideally) '''''all''''' wiki-articles are ''useful''.  23:16 Apr 23, 2003 (UTC)~Consider me in agreement with Kingturtle. I find following links addictive like eating potato chips or peanuts, & part of the fun of Wikipedia, as I explain on my home page. Feel free to debate me about this there.   23:35 Apr 23, 2003 (UTC)\n",

It can be stated abstractly as follows: if ''Ui'' are open subsets of ''X'' with union ''U'', then we get three maps: ''r''  ''F''(''U'') → Π''i'' ''F''(''Ui''), induced from the restrictions of ''F''(''U'') to the sets ''Ui'' ''s''  Π''i'' ''F''(''Ui'') → Π''k'',''l'' ''F''(''Uk'' ∩''Ul''), induced from the restrictions of ''F''(''Ui'') to the sets ''Ui''∩''Ul'' ''t''  Π''i'' ''F''(''Ui'') → Π''k'',''l'' ''F''(''Uk'' ∩''Ul''), induced from the restrictions of ''F''(''Ui'') to the sets ''Uk''∩''Ui''The sheaf axiom then says that ''r'' is the equalizer of ''s'' and ''t''. Obviously, for an arbitrary category '''C''' we would in addition have to assume that all occurring products exist in '''C'''.It's probably overkill to put this in the article. However, I don't entirely like the \"concrete category\" assumption either. In order to discuss stalks, we need that our category contains all direct limits, and not all concrete categories do.

It is true (by the way, \"big o-notation\" with 6,450 while \"big oh-notation\" with 2,990). But my impression is that although big o outweights big-oh, pages with good and formal writing seem to use big-oh notation. First it is consistent with other notations, big-omega and big-theta. Omega and theta are pronounciation of each letter, but so is big-O. Besides, see the list above. Only one textbook uses Big-O notation. I think it is logical to think that the sentence like''O'', ''Ω'' and ''Θ'' (big-Oh, big-Omega, big-Theta) are used in CS. And this is called big-oh notation.

            "How about dust bin vs. trash can vs. round file? TV vs. Tele? eye glasses vs. spectacles.I know that in New Zealand English, \"telly\" = US \"TV\".  I don't recall ever hearing anyone there use \"TV\", though they're familiar with the term from American television shows (ironic, isn't it, in a way? *grin*).  I didn't add it in because I don't know whether \"telly\" is common parlance in the UK.   ''It is (as in Teletubbies)  GWO''Can someone confirm the followings:muffin vs. English muffin? taxi vs. cab? police vs. cop?  garage vs. auto shop? parking vs. garage?  canteen vs. cafeteria? merry go round vs. carousel? xerox vs photocopier?  wheels vs. rims or links?  turn signals vs. blinkers? drug vs. medicine?Off the cuff Brit opinion:  Brits mainly call taxis taxis, except the London 'Black Cabs'; for Cop compare British Copper (a bit old fashioned); UK garage = US auto shop or US garage; UK Car Park = US Parking Lot; Brits use both Merry Go Round and Carousel; US xerox = UK photocopier; not heard of rims, links??; US turn signals = UK indicators (v. rarely blinkers); Brits use Drug and Medicine but Medicine more common.  Rims and links are two different names for the metal parts of the wheel, excluding the rubber tire.  How do the Brits call them?If whoever wrote this still wants an answer - define \"link\".  The wheel rim is the same in both (assuming it refers to the outer bit of the metal wheel).This is such a fun entry.   I once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldn't she tell the difference between USA-English and British English, she had trouble telling the difference between different European languages.  (Kind of keeps things in perspective, eh?) -)Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference. (If I saw it written I'd probably have somewhat more luck though.)  SJKVietnamese has more syllable-final consonants than Japanese, I think you can tell them apart that way, maybe. Is this right? - Someone suggested: \"Heath Robinson\" and \";Rube Goldberg\" as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, \"Rube Goldberg\" is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDCAs an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - .I think Americans certainly ''understand'' the use of \"bum\" for \"butt\", \"rubbish\" for \"trash\", and (to a lesser degree) \"flat\" for \"apartment\".  But we don't ''use'' those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say \"that's a trash can\"; a Brit will say \"that's a rubbish bin\".  Americans are more likely to use \"rubbish\" in the sense of \"bullshit\". LDCI deleted the following pair: \"limited (Ltd)\" and \"incorporated\", since they actually mean different things. \"Incorporated\" means a corporation; \"limited\" means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations). British (and Australian also) Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC.  I would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.Yes, I'd call it a \"torch\", and it would probably be labeled as a \"flashlight\" in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English  Oh, so \"flashlight\" is correct British usage? (My dictionary said [Am.] and the Oxford English Dictionary carried \"flashlight\" only in the meaning of photography.) Then I'll remove the entry again. AxelBoldtNo, I disagree, it's only a \"torch\" in BrE. The term \"flashlight\" if it occurs is still a striking Americanism, even if a manufacturer calls it that. - Would anyone be terribly put out if I table-ized the lists?  I realize that rendering the various vocabulary lists in HTML tables makes life more difficult for those who don't know how to create such code, so I'll understand if people prefer to leave things \"as-is\".  (But I think I detect a feature request in the making here...  quick'n'easy WikiTables, anyone?)   , 2002.03.092002.03.22: Having noted no objections, I've rendered the vocabulary lists into HTML tables.  Thanks!  ''[fanny (UK) = penis (US)? am I right?]''UK \"fanny\" means \"vagina\" (as is noted in the UK-to-US section). US \"fanny\" means \"buttocks\" (UK \"bum\"). On top of that, you put that into the US-to-UK section by mistake... ;)and while we're on those lines...\"fanny pack\" (US) -> \"bumper pack\" (UK) is one I've not heard of. \"Bum bag\" is the nearest UK term for these things that I've ever heard of.... But then I live way out in a rural area away from the Big City  You quite possibly may be right.  I was simply going on the story of an American exchange student who had spent a year in the UK, and had caused herself extreme embarrassment the first time she referred to the small satchel strapped around her waist as her \"fanny pack\" (meaning \"pack that rides on my butt\").  She was told to refer to it as a \"bumper pack\".  Needless to say, she never repeated ''that'' mistake again!  *grin*  Reading the \"American\" example of \"fitted\" Isn't Michael Crichton British?  No, he is one of yours! \"Tap\" isn't restricted to beer; the things in my bathroom are taps. Not that giving the world at large the impression that wikipedians are closet alcoholics is necessarily a ''bad'' thing... ;-)  I believe so as well. Straight \"faucet\" is more common, at least in the Pacific Northwest, than \"tap\", but \"tap\" is still used frequently (the term \"tap water\" is actually extremely common). I think it should probably be dumped from the page, or at least qualified as something along the lines of \"tap alone is usualy understood to reffer to the \"tap\" of a beer keg, but is not restricted to that\".  20:48 Dec 19, 2002 (UTC)According to Merriam-Webster OnLine, \"stroller\" means a pushchair (not a pram, as the article claims). Can someone confirm this? , Thursday, June 13, 2002\"Pushchair\" seems appropriate.  It seems to me that the more usual translation for \"pram\" (or \"perambulator\") is \"baby buggy\" or \"baby buggy\" or often just simply \"buggy\". What distinguishes a \"stroller\" from these is that it is a much lighter object that is used after a child has mastered sitting-up, and has begun to develop his walking skills.  A stroller can be collapsed into a carryable object to be brought out when it's time for a nap, or as a threat to a wandering two-year-old's mobility.  IMOH there is a trend away from bulky expensive baby-buggies for the pre-ambulatory, and a preference for back-pack and similar arrangements.According to the New Oxford the word \"stroller\" takes on yet another meaning in South Africa, where it can refer to a young urban vagrant or street child. On pronunciation, I am puzzled by the claim that AmE collapses the vowels of \"all\" and \"awl\", since I don't know of an accent that distinguishes these. They're both [O:l] in BrE and similar accents (such as Australian). - A couple of points:''The \"a\" of father is used in many British words, especially common ones, in two phonetic situations. Firstly, before three of the four voiceless fricatives, as in path, laugh, chaff, pass, past, though not before sh. Secondly, before some instances of n and another consonant, as in aunt, plant, dance. (Australian does not follow British in this second case.) But by no means all words follow this pattern, e.g. ant is the same as in American.''This is far from universal in England, though it is the \"received pronunciation\".  All Northern English accents use the flat \"a\", as in America.Secondly, should this page be called \"American and English English Differences\". The Scottish British is Substantially different, though Welsh English is no more different than regional English usages. The article begins by describing how Standard British needs to be understood - certain forms of Southern England English. See my remark below on dividing up dialects. There just is no simple name for the non-American variety we're comparing. I have described the british meaning of ass as donkey, burro. My wife (from Texas ) uses burro, but I don't know if this is regional usage or standard AE 09:02 Sep 12, 2002 (UTC)Burro is Spanish for donkey.  There are a lot of Spanish speakers in Texas so Spanish words are more commonly used by English speakers in Texas than in, say Indiana. \"Ass\", \"donkey\", and \"burro\" are all standard American English, and should be understood anywhere. Americans generally only use \"ass\" for its other meanings, and \"burro\" is more commonly used in Spanish-influenced areas like Texas and California, but they're still all quite common. (As a totally irellevant aside, \"burro\" is also slang for \"buttocks\" in SpanishI'm sure there's an interesting reason for that, but I have no idea what it is.)  I would like to add the British/American use of \"rubbish\" and/or \"trash\" as a verb, if they have different meanings. In Britain they have two different meanings. (UK) To rubbish something, is to talk badly about it. He rubbished Fred's house... he said it was useless, run down, untidy etc. (UK) To trash something is to physically destroy it. He trashed Fred's house... he smashed all the windows, broke the furniture etc.I am not sure of the US meanings, are they the same?we use \"trash\" for both.  \"Rubbish\" we (some of us) understand as a noun, but we never use it as a verb.  Trash a hotel room, trash a reputation.... This usage does of course call for the occasional clarification.  \"You mean physically, or he just talked bad about it?\"  Chris Q - thanks for fixing the comment on RP - I was just going back to do it - honest!A comment about the singular \"they\" - surely this is not solely an aspect of British English - I've heard it used just about everywhere (US, Oz, NZ, that is) as a less cumbersome version of he/she (ditto \"their\" instead of \"his/her\"). There's an etymological justice to this: \"you\" was originally plural only, the singular was \"thou\", but \"thou\" died out and got replaced by it's plural. - The statement as it appears in the article is confusing, but I ''think'' it's trying to say that the use of singular they is somewhat more acceptable in writen usage in Britain than in the US. I have no idea if this is true. How about \"Oriental\" traditionally in British English it refers to the middle-east, but in US English and in modern British English it refers to the east asia area ?I think we (British) use \"Oriental\" to refer to the far east, Orientals are what Americans would call Asians. In the US refering to someone as Oriental is non-PC.During the Victorian period \"Oriental\" often meant the Middle-East. By the time of World War II the term meant the Far East. The \"East\" was often linked with the Silk Route to China and the countries associated with it. The area around Malaysia, Thailand, etc. were referred to as the \"South Sea\". I think it is just one of those terms that changed its meaning during the Imperial period.''Though most English accents pronounce the T's in words as a distinctive T it is common, particularly in Estuary English? to replace the T with a glottal stop. ''Does anyone know the rules for this, for example \"I stopped at the pottery on Saturday\" would be pronounced as \"I s'''t'''opped at the po'ery on Sa'urday\". Why is the T in stopped pronounced?I would assume only intervocalic T's are realized as glottal stops. In 'stopped' it's part of a consonant cluster rather than sitting between nice comfy vowels where it can sink into the cushions of the mouth and stop in the glottis. This is where the idea of \"British\" English breaks down.  Different dialects handle this differently.  Some use glottal stops commonly whereas others use them only rarely.  If anyone can devise a culturally neutral name for picking out the Standard British dialect, I shall be eternally grateful. Essentially the main dialects are Southern British, Northern British, Scottish, American, and Caribbean. The Southern British dialect covers a host of different accents, RP and Estuary and Welsh and Australasian and South African. 'Standard British' is okay to cover RP and Estuary, but we want a term that includes the southern hemisphere accents and is opposed as a whole to American (as a vocabulary source) or to Standard American (rhotic accents only). Any takers? ;-) And while they're about it, they can devise a Standard British dialect to go with the culturally neutral name. ) On the specific point of glottalling, traditional RP has none and London Cockney (''not'' a form of Standard British) probably only keeps [t] initially and after [s], as in ''tar, star, dust, dusty'', and I'm not even sure about ''dust''. Elsewhere it's [?], as in [wEn?] ''went'', [wIn?a] ''winter'' etc. The modern form of RP and full-blown Estuary English are intermediate. An RP speaker these days will probably use [?] before a consonant, in casual speech: [nQ? ri:li] ''not really''. The change to Estuary includes more glottalling, intervocalic and final: [nQ? @ lQ?] ''not a lot''. Estuary seems to be replacing RP as de facto standard, so this tendency will count as, if it does not yet, part of Standard British.  I've never heard the word Binky for pacifier. The British word is Dummy so I'll change it.A question for US speakers: In the UK we call the floor at ground level ''the ground floor'' and the floor above that ''the first floor'' whilst in th US these are known as ''the first floor''  and ''the second floor'' respectively. Does ''the ground floor'' have any meaning in the US? i.e. is it a synonym for ''the first floor'' or is it unknown. I wish to know which list to put these phrases in.The ground floor is a synonym for the first floor. Thanks Tokerboy!  01:23 Dec 4, 2002 (UTC)I've lived in America my entire life and I have never seen \"amoeba\" or \"aesthetic\" spelled \"ameba\" or \"esthetic\".  Am I weird?  01:55 Dec 4, 2002 (UTC) No I think there are a few inaccuracies in this article, caused by the very differences it discusses. \"Binky\" and \"Bumper Bag\" (should be Bum Bag) were two items listed as British that I'd never heard of. I've taken both out. I've seen these spellings maybe a half dozen times in my life, and all of them were in casual conversation and all were cases where the writer had /no/ clue how they were actually spelled.  20:39 Dec 19, 2002 (UTC)Kwertii, I've taken them out again. These bastardizations are not in real use in the United States, '''''they simply are not there'''''. This is based on what is in common usage, not what ''might'' be plausible.   05:00 Dec 20, 2002 (UTC)I've lived in the US my entire life, and I've seen both lots of times. \"esthetic\" is pretty uncommon, but not unheard of, and \"ameba\" is somewhat more common: http://www.biologycorner.com/worksheets/amebacolor.html http://www.bartleby.com/65/am/ameba.html http://www.ndif.org/Terms/ameba.html http://pittsford.monroe.edu/jefferson/calfieri/Animals/Ameba.html http://amebamarketing.com/ http://shadowboxent.brinkster.net/ameba.html etc. (search on google for lots more references) http://www.estheticacademy.org/ http://www.echonyc.com/~onissues/su98coventry.html http://www.starsmile.com/ http://estheticvisionsdentalarts.com/ http://www.estheticsupersite.com/ etc. (again, lots more examples on google)I'm an American and \"ameba\" looks laughably misspelled to me; I was surprised to note that the dictionary I checked listed it as an alternate spelling, as I too have never seen it used. At such it's a poor and misleading example. Perhaps it was more common in the past, or in certain quarters? \"Esthetic\" seems okay, though.  03:03 Dec 21, 2002 (UTC)Ameba is by no means uncommon, though perhaps less common than \"amoeba\". Regardless of how it looks or whether it's \"correct\" or not, lots of Americans indisputably spell it as \"ameba\", (including some biology texts, incidentally); therefore I have to say I think it's a perfectly valid example. The British expression \"I couldn't care less\" is rendered as \"I could care less\" in the US. To a British English speaker this appears to mean the opposite.I'm a native American English speaker, and I think both of these expressions are synonyms meaning \"I do not care at all.\" Any other American types agree? And what is the British meaning of these two? 02:00 Dec 4, 2002 (UTC)\"I could care less\" is never used in the UK and if you said it to a Brit he would probably think you mis-said it and might even try to correct you.  02:07 Dec 4, 2002 (UTC)But \"I couldn't care less\" still means that you ''don't'' care, right?  It means \"I couldn't care less\". i.e. I care so little that there is no room for me to care less.\"I could care less\" is equally bad American.  The people who say it are just being lazy.  It ''does'' mean the opposite of what they're trying to say.   No, it is an American idiom.  It doesn't make sense but millions of people say it.  It has nothing to to with laziness.  It means \"I don't care.\"  It is synonymous with \"I couldn't care less\", also an idiom, a little more logical, that also means \"I don't care.\"  ''I always thought the idiom arouse as a contraction of \"I could care less, but not much less\" (or sentiments like that).  But I don't know anything  GWO''''Entree'' is a weird one. ''entree'' is French and means first course or what you call the appetizer. How the hell did this one get so mixed up. what is it for Canadians?  02:17 Dec 4, 2002 (UTC) I was told it meant first course in Canada.  Mind you, I had no idea what it meant at all, so it may not be that common a term in the UK. Is the American ''normalcy'' for ''normality'' a one-off, or would we also have ''totalcy'' for ''totality'', ''brutalcy'' for ''brutality'' etc?   14:41 Feb 10, 2003 (UTC)Not really.  We Americans have both words:''normality'' means all the normal things, including chemistry, etc.''normalcy'' means \"the usual condition of things, particularly political, social, or economic\", as in, \"the return to normalcy after the war\".It is popular to consider ''normalcy'' an irregular usage, but it is far too common in this single specialized meaning to be disdained.  Could someone explain what cafe means in America?  The article says \"French cafe\", but what's that?  I'd always thought they meant pretty much the same thing. It'd be good to dump that stuff about using Southern Jessieish as standard \"British English\", too.  A lot of the stuff now mentions dialects, but I don't know if we're quite ready yet.Talking of which, I've never heard anyone pronounce \"chaff\" as \"charf\", so I'm taking that out.  Willing to admit I could be wrong, though.\"Some Americans differentiate between 'aunt' and 'ant', but some do not.\" - I dumped this, too as the same is true in the UK.  It may have a place in the article, but it seemed a bit incongruous where it was. In Hiberno-English 'ride' is slang for 'sex' or someone who you want to a sex with, as in 'He is a ride'.  I am not sure if it exists in British-English. (One one notorious TV moment, a gang of Irish tourists being followed by a TV programme went into hysterics at the sight of an American tour guide in Disneyland, who told them (and couldn't understand why it was producing such merriment) how Disneyland had the biggest 'rides' in America, how she loved 'riding' everywhere around Disneyland, how tourists came from all over the world to 'ride' in Disneyland, and how she had possibly had more 'rides' in Disneyland than anyone else.  Result: fifteen Irish people with tears in their eyes from laughing, almost collapsing onto the group, as the woman says \"Gee. You Irish! Ok. You wanna ride with me?\" Does anyone know if 'ride' has the same sexual meanings in British-English as Hiberno-English? (Obviously, unless the Disneyland Madam didn't know her American-English, 'ride' doesn't have sexual connotations in the US.)  21:37 Feb 16, 2003 (UTC)No. Ride in that context isn't used in British English, except where it might be blatently obvious that you mean a euphemism for sex. Ride in a sexual context is certainly understood in USA English (going back at least to the 1920s with old blues songs refering to \"Easy rider\", and appearing in such slang phrases as \"moustache ride\") but the non sexual meaning is far more common.  Most Americans wouldn't have noticed any sort of double entendre in the Disneyland tourguide's statement.  There was some old television series set in England with an American female lead, whose character's first name was Randy.  Every time she introduced herself to the English people on the show, they'd all go off into peals of laughter.  That reminds me of the \"Jessie\"  mention Night-Rider. I was a student when that was first broadcast (in a Nothern University) and everytime there was a comment like \"There is a Jessie waiting for you\" there were fits of laughter, followed by someone saying \"eee, ya big girl's blouse!\".   07:27 Feb 17, 2003 (UTC)''Yes, ''Jessie'' is a slang term meaning camp queen (which on this side of the Atlantic is a camp gay man) or in some areas simply gay.  02:03 Feb 18, 2003 (UTC)Does 'Randy' not mean . . . well . . . randy (ie, sex-mad or sex-starved and look for sex) in the US? On a totally different point - do we include words that mean the same but in a different context in either the US or UK mean the opposite of what you would presume? For example:In the US - '''public school''' means ordinary schoolIn the UK - '''public school''' means fee paying elitist ''private'' school. eg, Eton.  01:18 Feb 17, 2003 (UTC)In rural southern Ontario Protestant english (I can't speak for other areas or for the minority of people who went through Catholic schools) a '''public school''' is the school one goes to before high school (or before Junior High if there happens to be one). It is equivalent to elementary school. p. stoltzfusNo, ''randy'' has no sexual connotation in the US at all.   Since ''Austin Powers'', a lot of Americans are at least aware of the meaning as a Britishism, though no one really uses it. What does ''camp'' (as a description of a person) mean in the US? In Britain it refers to an overtly feminate, foppish homosexual male. I get the impression that in the US it is used to describe what we would call a \"ham actor\". It does not appear to have homosexual connotations.   07:30 Feb 19, 2003 (UTC)It does have that connotation, I think, but to a much lesser degree.  Most Americans would never think of describing a gay man as ''camp'', though many or most would get it if someone else did so.  In this sense, the word is simply not used in the US.  From a literary POV, on college campuses and the like, ''camp'' refers to (I think) movies and plays and such that are not enjoyed on the basis of how good they are, but on the basis of how bad they are due to ham acting and other weaknesses.  In spite of this, the term is also used to describe genuinely quality stories like ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' which is camp because it is flamboyantly sexually ambiguous and does not rely on traditional notions of quality in order to tell its story (still a connection to ''flaming'' homosexuals, a much more common term that may be unique to the US).  In conclusion, I don't know, though most Americans would never think of referring to an outrageously feminine gay man with ''camp'', even if they understand what it means. I may have misinterpeted you.  In the US, if the average person sees a flaboyantly gay man on the street, they'd say \"wow, that dude is flaming\".  Nobody would say \"wow, that dude is camp\". No your explanation is fine. It seems that ''camp'' in the US is one of those difficult to pin down concepts. Another American said to me \"well I can't really describe what it means, but you know it when you see it!\"   08:06 Feb 19, 2003 (UTC)\n",

You are sure Lubbock is a town and you don't really care about it, but you want to know where Texas is located; using Lubbock, Texas forces them to go to Lubbock and then to Texas, whereas, using Lubbock, Texas requires only one step.

Introduce yourself and let us know why you think things are wrong on the '''''talk''''' pages.   Taking a side, Zoe? Ethnocentrism not something your over quite yet?Rabbi Michael Lerner - A link for you, Zoe. And \"we\" know where ''your'' bigotries stand, now dont we?  -Actually that really isn't clear in this matter. And ''that'' means that Zoe is doing something right. Your views are very obvious, however. I saw your comments on the Jewish religion, SV, so I don't need to say any more on that subject.  But no, we '''don't''' know where my bigotries stand, why don't you enlighten us?  Zoe, I must take issue with wholesale reverts of everything Martha is doing. For example, I don't think the Irgun article needed to be reverted. Please take a moment to read the changes she makes before reverting. Never mind, it appears you are doing so anyway. Apologies. I second that. Its important to actually read the material before you revert it. As for claims of my anti-Semitism - I dont know what to say. Im not Jewish. excuse me, for seeing issues quite differently. Be well. -I know you're not Jewish.  That's pretty clear from the attacks you make on the religion. Neither am I, by the way.  Hi Zoe,I only meant that not -all- of what Martha was writing was POV. Much of what RK writes is also POV, but I don't think that means we should go around reverting everything he writes. We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, is all I'm saying. I agree, much of what RK writes is valid. but some of it is not, and Im happy to call attention to it, regardless of what people in their assumptions, might chose to label me. The canary in question is in the very bad habit of blanket reverting anything some of us do without even reading it. The fact that its tolerated speaks volumes. The fact that its supported.... well. What more can be said? Be well, again. -RK, I disagree with you on reverting Palestinian exodus.  I don't think the current version is NPOV.   Disagreement is one thing. That is Ok by me. But Marth's wholesale censorship of pertinent facts, especially from the ''Arab point of view'', seems irresponsible to me. Martha is pretending that the Arab views of the 1990s and 2000s are the same as the Arab views of the 1940s and 1950s. That is not only wrong, but I would hold deliberately deceptive. I don't mind of other people take a crack at NPOV that article at all. And it would be informative to see how the Arab POV changed. I just disagree with the inappropriate form of historical revisionism that Martha pushes. For one thing, that article badly needs organization and summaries of the relevant opinions. Right now it reads like a badly glued together mess of quotes, and it's very easy to take a side by selecting only certain quotes. Aack! I should have gotten an edit conflict on My Sister Eileen but for some reason didn't. You may want to take a look at it: I don't think anything got left out, but it would be good to check.

Good work on all the new additions, by the way.   Thanks. I '''thought''' I should have 'cause I added \"Wonderful Town\" and then looking at the history saw that it had already been added (but it was already in there and I had to take out one version, so I was wrong about the conflict!)   -Zoe, I left a response for you on my user talk page -Hi. Please read my comments on User talk:Maveric149.  04:17 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)Hello, Zoe. I've just noticed that you've deleted quite a lot of things from February 11. May I ask what criteria you used to decide what to delete?   05:33 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)They were a lot of nonentities.  We either need to make very day page thousands of links long, listing everybody who was every born or died and every event that ever happened, or we need to be more concise.  Why list only a few of the people who won the men's and women's US figure skating championships?  Why not list all of them?  And then why not list every person who's ever won any country's figure skating championship?  I'm pretty well-versed in American sports, and I never heard of these so-called American athletes in basketball, baseball, football, whatever they were.  I did leave a lot of cricket players because I don't know how famous they are.    Hmm... That's a good point about the page getting ridiculously long, but how are we to decide what to keep there? I'm a little worried that if the decision of who to keep is just based on how familiar they sound to you, then... well, isn't that inserting your own POV about what is important and what isn't? What we need is a good old NPOV criterion for deciding what to include, that doesn't rely on subjective judgements. Hmm. Well, for people, we could say that they can be included if they have a substantial article - say over 1 K in size - or something like that. That way it would discourage people from putting relatively unknown people in, or encourage them to do more work in writing articles! As for events, I'm not sure what criteria one could use. I don't know much about US history, but I gather that an African-American woman being hired as flight attendant in 1958 would be a pretty big deal, coming quite soon after the Montgomery bus thing and all that. And isn't the sinking of a passenger ship in which 322 people die quite a big thing? As I say, I can see why you want to shorten the page, but I hate to see information that people have gone to the trouble of typing in just going down the drain! I know this would be extra work, but I wonder if maybe instead of deleting the information altogether, you could just cut and paste it somewhere else, like the talk page, and then other people can work out a better place to put it...? That way the page would be shrunk, but the information wouldn't be lost. I hope that sounds reasonable to you! Sorry if it doesn't. )   06:03 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)Well, the information isn't lost, because it's still in the Older verstions page.    Well, most people don't go hunting through older versions just to check what's been removed. I do myself, but I'm just weird. ;) To go through every line in an \"Older versions\" page - and there can be dozens for some pages - just to find out what has been removed is quite tiring, believe me. It would be easier for everyone (except for the person doing it, of course!) if removed information were placed on the talk page, where they'd know where to look for it. Furthermore, talk pages are searchable using the \"Search\" function, whereas older versions aren't, as far as I can tell. So if you take out a note about an event which is only mentioned on a date page, no-one would be able to find it by doing a Search, and they'd probably just end up having to research when the event happened all over again. Why not copy the information into a relevant page, like, say moving the figure-skating champions to a figure-skating page or something? It really would make life easier for people.   06:31 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)But most of the people I deleted didn't have articles about them anyway.    You mean ''some'' of them ''did''!? *gasp!* For those that didn't, you could always write stubs for them. Or send me the names, and I could write stubs for them. ) But in any case, I still don't see what's wrong with the idea of moving information to the talk page. You could just keep Notepad or whatever open, and then instead of \"select, delete\" you could do \"select, cut, move mouse to Notepad, paste\", which wouldn't take all that much longer, and then once you've collected all the cut bits, you just copy the lot and paste it into the talk page. Simple! ) Oh, go on, I'll write a message to the mailing list in support of your proposed sysop status if you do. Wouldn't that be nice? (Or has it been given to you already?)   06:50 Feb 11, 2003 (UTC)Hey Zoe:Moving the Bayamon article to it's new heading, I noticed you had asked the question of 'what is a holding bridge?\" on the talk page. Honestly, I just noticed that you had that question, so Im sorry that Im answering so late, as the question was posted in September.A ''Holding Bridge'' is what I use to describe such bridges as the Brooklyn bridge or the Golden Gate bridge. I used that phrase, because in Spanish, actually, thats how people call it. But I have no idea what the name of those types of bridges is in English. Maybe Cable bridge or something..I dont know...Perhaps you could fix the article with the right name )Once again, thanks for reading my articles, and God bless you!!Sincerely yours,''Please tell us what you plan on accomplishing by doing this''Providing ground for Wikipedia:self-references updates  Zoe, ''First Past the Post'' is the ''formal actual name'' of an electoral system. We already have a mess on Wiki where people seem to mis-understand different systems and are merging slightly similar systems (eg, though the entire political science world refers to ''Proportional Representation through Single transferable Vote'' - PR.STV (and use capitals to denote it) , Wiki insists on calling it Single transferable vote, which is not the same thing, particularly when by not using capitals you don't make clear that you are talking about the actual voting system, not a different aspect of the electoral process.)The whole point with using capitals is to make clear that you are dealing with the ''formal''  process under the formal name. First past the post could mean an election result, a variation on the process or a topic unrelated to elections at all. FIrst Past the Post (using capitals) is the formal ''name'' of a clearly defined election system, just as ''Single Transferable Vote'' is a formal ''name'' of a clearly defined election election system, and ''Proportional Representation through SIngle Transferable Vote'' is the formal name of a clearly defined election system.  If things have formal names, ''deliberately'' given to them to distinguish the ''formal ''system from a ''general'' description on something related to the topic, they should be used. There is absolutely no logic in not using capitals for what capitals are intended to do, formally distinguish definitions & titles from anything else. (I've had the nightmare of correcting essays of students who get all confused because they cannot recognise a name or definition from general information. Wikipedia is simply going to make people even more confused if it decides not to use capitals on formal names that are intended to be capitalised. Or maybe we should just forget about capitals and mix up queen and Queen, write about pope john paul the same way we would write about slippers. And then wonder why people cannot make head or tail of it all.) I am rather bolshie on this I know, but I have had the experience over the years of being b*******d by lecturers for writing first past the post when I should have written First Past the Post or pr.stv for PR.STV. Wiki should be about raising people's standard of accuracy and level of english, not dumbing down. High standards shouldn't just apply to the contents of articles. They should also apply to the titles. 'First past the post' makes no sense in political science terms and no sense grammatically as an article headline.  03:19 Feb 14, 2003 (UTC)Hey, Zoe. Check out my edit on Servant. You might want to put that article/user on your radar.  04:04 Feb 16, 2003 (UTC)I just wanted to say thanks for being a great editor.  You're often criticized, but I wanted to make sure you know I think you're a valued contributor and I almost always agree with you, even when I don't (if that makes any sense).  Thanks for being committed to the project.  07:37 Feb 16, 2003 (UTC)Very true words. I feel the same. )  07:56 Feb 16, 2003 (UTC)Are you working on February 18 yet - I was going to give it a go but I don't want us to be working on the same thing at the same time.  03:48 Feb 18, 2003 (UTC)mav, I'm working on it right now.   OK - I'll work on something else. ) mavAhh.. sorry I thought I'd created that test page in my user workspace and not the encylopaedia workspace. Dear Hi! Thanks for fixing the Bayamon article with the phrase ''suspension bridge''. Your observance is deeply appreciated as is your helpness.Thanks and God bless you!Sincerely yours,Dear Zoe:Well, thank you, and thank you again!!! LOL ...thanks for asking the question first, and then for letting me know who fixed the page. Im going to thank him right now.God bless!!Sincerely yours,Hey, I forgot that I read and then accidentally deleted your e-mail when my short-term memory wasn't functioning properly and, of course you can call me Tuf, as I am in fact quite tough, indestructible to all normal weapons (and also a cat, one of the rare Virginian-kind with opposable thumbs). If you have a spare moment there is a formatting question at Talk:Historical anniversaries/Example. Yes, Zoe, I am planning on linking all those (very very very small) pictures into a page (actually I already have) and I -promise- I **Promise** that it will make sense why I did. really.To discuss the theological and historical idea of the construction of the \"mother temples\" around the world (all 7) takes the pictures.  Trust me, I'm not blasting pictures all over the wikipedia, and I'm not going to do some weird religious screed.  I'll be NPOV and try to be demure.But I understand your concern.  Really.  But there's a point.  Give me 48 hours to get it all cleaned up ok?   06:41 Feb 21, 2003 (UTC)~Zoe, I don't think changing the word 'with' to 'on' on the [UN . . . Iraq] page solves the problem. ''on'' and ''with'' are both used, the former by anti-war people, the latter by pro-war people. So we have just moved one POV and replaced it for another. I've another suggestion: instead call it ' The UN Security Council and the proposed Iraq war'. That way you avoid ''any'' hint of bias, by all words that could be seen as in any way expressing a POV and instead calling it a term that all sides would be able to use: the Proposed Iraq War. What do you think?  00:28 Feb 22, 2003 (UTC).   00:49 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC)Hey Zoe!Last time you and I spoke, I had been here a week or so, and you seemingly forever (to a newcomer like me, anyway). I inappropriately called you out when your were being entirely reasonable. But newcomers like me (and you were one, once) don't see what's happening here until they get used to the culture[?].Anyway, the business of (crap, what was it called?) ''Amerocentrism'' is a real one, I think. Please! Bear with me. I'm not angry at anyone, and I've learned to read your edits with appreciation.It's not, for me at least (maybe there are others who are angry), whether Americans talk about what they know. It's whether they impose a US viewpoint on non-US issues. The example that most affected me is the page on Japanese cuisine. The current page is written almost entirely entirely by me, but I've seen four (five?) people edit that page with an eye to how Japanese cuisine has affected the United States. No one has edited it to say how it has affected any country in Europe, Asia, or Africa, however. There is an odd \"Amerocentrism\" that has affected the discussion of a cuisine 4000 miles away.I deleted some of it, crunched most of it into a single topic at the end of article (so as not to censure Americans), but I'd still rather delete it all. Japan is not America, you know?So i think that sometimes people are not unhappy about Americans talking about what they know (your really decent phrase), they're unhappy about Americans talking about  stuff that has nothing to do with them as if USA is the topic.Best wishes,(and I totally respect you) 01:52 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC)My understanding of the deletion policy was that pages shouldn't be just be summarily deleted in the middle of a dispute about them. That's what the Votes for deletion page is for.   02:32 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC) I recall a policy that one shouldn't delete pages until a week after they were listed, especially in the case of '''possible''' copyright violation. If you read the top of the VfD page it says, in bold no less, '''Page titles should stay listed for a minimum of a week before a decision is made'''. In this context I'm thinking of Pathological narcissism, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Inverted Narcissists, all of which were listed on the 22nd Feb and deleted today (23rd Feb). One would prefer to have waited for a week (29th Feb). Hiya Zoe. I think the martini stuff can be deleted.  03:50 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC)Sorry, Zoe, perhaps I should have explained myself a bit better! I meant that my understanding of the deletion process is that when someone wants a page to be deleted, they put it on the Votes for deletion page, and, after it has been up for discussion for at least a week, another uninvolved sysop can delete the page, if that's what seems to be the general consensus.It's just that on a few occasions now you have deleted pages in the middle of an ongoing conflict about whether they should exist or not. For example, on the morning of 16th February, you deleted one page (2000 Elections) four times in quick succession. Clearly someone thought the page was worth having, and you disagreed. So you should have put it on \"Votes for deletion\". I don't think it should be up to you to unilaterally decide that a page is worthless. What made me bring the issue up last night was a similar event. I'm not sure if I can remember the details correctly, because the history has gone. But it went something like this... Someone had made a page about a supposed swear word in Arabic. Someone else blanked it out, and then someone else added some more text. And then you deleted the whole page. Later this morning, you went on to delete several other pages that had been listed on \"Votes for deletion\" for only a very short time.Now, I'm not making any comment about whether or not all these pages were worth having or not. But I don't think it's up to you to make unilateral decisions on the matter. That's what \"Votes for deletion\" is for. It specifically says on the page, in bold lettering, \"'''Page titles should stay listed for a minimum of a week before a decision is made.'''\" That way the matter is no longer solely your responsibility; other people can debate the merits or otherwise of the disputed pages, and there's no need to get into \"deletion wars\" with people.   16:43 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC)Leave it go, Zoe. I'm sure your suspicions are correct, but SM is behaving as well as any of us right now (better than some!) and seems determined to start afresh. If there is a return to the bad old days, I will be the first to join with you on this, but for now, why don't we just take her on face value as a useful Wikipedis contributor? Early days, but she's doing just fine. \n",

            "Removed from article because its in the wrong language. See also:Mit dem Gesicht zum Meer, aber auch nach EuropaDer portugiesische Humanist Damiao de Góis zwischen den Fronten der europäischen GlaubensspaltungWolfgang PlochFernand Braudel, der große französische Sozialhistoriker fand es bemerkenswert, daß sich der Schwerpunkt Europas im 16. Jahrhundert von Süden nach Norden verschob, also nach Antwerpen und dann nach Amsterdam und nicht nach Sevilla oder Lissabon, den Zentren der spanischen und portugiesischen Reiche. Die Lebensgeschichte des Damiano de Góis liest sich wie eine Illustration zu dieser Fragestellung und enthält zugleich Elemente einer Antwort.An einem Aprilabend des Jahres 1531 ist ein junger Portugiese im Hause Martin Luthers am Stadtgraben in Wittenberg zu Gast. Dem Sprachgemisch aus Latein und Deutsch, das an Luthers Tafel herrscht, kann der Portugiese gut folgen. Er ist Handelsagent des portugiesischen Königs in Antwerpen und reist an den polnischen Königshof. Sein Abstecher nach Wittenberg sei rein privat, betont er. Die Gastgeber sind neugierig und wohlwollend. Der Besucher faßt Vertrauen zu dem feinsinnigen und bescheidenen Philipp Melanchthon, dem Verfasser des ersten protestantischen Bekenntnisses. Luther imponiert ihm zwar, doch findet er ihn zu derb, zu fanatisch. Vor der Abreise verabreden die beiden Reformatoren mit ihrem Gast, brieflich in Kontakt zu bleiben.Damiao de Gois wurde 1502 in Alenquer geboren, einem Provinznest vierzig Kilometer nördlich von Lissabon. Da die Familie adelig war, trat der kleine Damiao im Alter von neun Jahren als Page in den Dienst des Königs. Der portugiesische Königshof und die Stadt Lissabon boten in diesem zweiten Jahrzehnt des 16. Jahrhunderts genug Anregungen und Träume für ein ganzes Leben. Die portugiesischen Karavellen fuhren von hier hinaus über die Weiten des Indischen Ozeans, vom Kap der guten Hoffnung bis nach Goa, vom Persischen Golf bis zu den Gewürzinseln am Rande des Chinesischen Meers. Sie brachten nicht nur begehrte Waren mit. Auch die exotischsten Menschen und Tiere wurden in Lissabon an Land gebracht. Der kleine Page hatte Mitleid mit den verängstigten brasilianischen Indianern. Und er bewunderte die stolzen Abgesandten des Kaisers von Äthiopien, die 1513/14 nach Lissabon kamen, um dem portugiesischen König ein Bündnis anzubieten. Denn 1493 war der Portugiese Pero da Covilha bis nach Äthiopien an den Hof des \"Negus negesti\", des \"Königs der Könige\", vorgedrungen und hatte dort schwarze Christen gefunden, die Erben jenes legendären Reichs des \"Priesters Johannes\", das im 4. Jahrhundert zum Christentum übergetreten und seitdem von Europa abgeschnitten gewesen war.Am liebsten wäre der junge Góis Seefahrer geworden wie Vasco da Gama. Doch dem stand sein eher schwächlicher Körper entgegen. König Manuel I. hatte eine andere Idee für diesen jungen Mann mit Fernweh und gutem Gespür für Zahlen. So kam Góis im Jahre 1523 als Sekretär des portugiesischen Handelskontors nach Antwerpen. Hier wurden Gewürze, Seide, Gold, Silber und andere Waren aus Übersee abgesetzt. Im Gegenzug kauften die portugiesischen Handelsagenten Weizen und Manufakturgüter ein. Der An- und Verkauf lief über private Zwischenhändler. Damiao de Góis mußte immer wieder bei der Verwaltung der habsburgischen Niederlande intervenieren, um die Rechte portugiesischer Kaufleute zu verteidigen. Die beherrschende Stellung der Portugiesen im Handel mit Gewürzen sahen viele europäische Zeitgenossen mit kritischen Augen. Nutzten die Portugiesen ihr Monopol nicht schamlos aus? Nahmen sie nicht überzogene Preise? Góis konterte wie ein moderner Interessenvertreter: Die hohen Preise seien gerechtfertigt, denn die Portugiesen hätten in ihre Übersee-Expansion viel Geld investiert. Jahrzehntelang hätten sie hohe Risiken auf sich genommen, Menschen und Schiffe verloren. Als Góis seine Argumente in einem Pamphlet veröffentlichte, gewann er die wohlwollende Unterstützung der Fugger in Augsburg, die die portugiesischen Entdeckungsreisen mitfinanziert hatten.Góis' handelsdiplomatische Tätigkeit konnte seine Neugier und seinen Wissensdurst nicht befriedigen. Er suchte den Zugang zu den gebildetsten Menschen seiner Zeit, den europäischen Humanisten. Doch dafür brauchte er Nachhilfestunden in Latein, der Arbeits- und Verkehrssprache der Humanisten. Er engagierte einen belesenen Privatlehrer namens Cornelius Grapheus. Der hatte gerade unter dem Verdacht der lutherischen Ketzerei ein Jahr im Gefängnis zugebracht. Schon im Jahr der Ankunft des jungen Góis in Antwerpen waren unter der gleichen Anklage zwei Augustinermönche in Brüssel verbrannt und das Augustinerkloster in Antwerpen zerstört worden. Doch der wißbegierige Portugiese kannte offensichtlichlich keine Berührungsangst. Er unterstützte Grapheus, der seine Stelle als Sekretär der Stadt Antwerpen verloren hatte, und absolvierte bei ihm eine Art Studium generale. Seinem Ruf am fernen Lissaboner Königshof tat das offenbar keinen Abbruch. König Johann III. beauftragte Góis sogar mit zwei geheimen Missionen in Polen und Dänemark, bei denen es um dynastische Heiratsprojekte und Neutralitätsabsprachen im Kriegsfall ging. Auf seiner zweiten Reise 1531 machte Góis dann jenen Abstecher nach Wittenberg zu Luther und Melanchthon.Der Wanderer zwischen den Fronten reiste weiter nach Danzig, wo er sich lange mit dem aus dem protestantischen Schweden verjagten Bischof Johannes Magnus unterhielt. Die beiden Männer waren sich schnell einig: Warum konnte es nicht verschiedene Wege geben, Christ zu sein? Góis erzählte Magnus von den Äthiopiern, die ihn seit seiner frühen Jugend faszinierten. Warum hatten der Papst und die europäischen Fürsten diese fernen Christen nicht als Glaubensbrüder und ebenbürtige Partner anerkannt? Johannes Magnus ermutigte seinen Gesprächspartner, er solle doch ein Buch darüber schreiben. Nach Antwerpen zurückgekehrt, verfaßte Góis eine Schrift über die \"Gesandtschaft des Priester Johannes zu König Manuel von Portugal im Jahre 1513\". Kurz nach Veröffentlichung der Schrift 1532 in Latein erschienen eine englische und eine deutsche Übersetzung, Beweis für das große Interesse an dem exotischen Thema. Damit hatte sich Góis Zugang zu den humanistischen Zirkeln verschafft. Sogar der große Erasmus von Rotterdam nahm ihn nun zur Kenntnis. Erasmus verstand das Anliegen des dreißig Jahre Jüngeren: Nachdem sich die Humanisten in ihrem kosmopolitischen Ansatz bisher nur am alten Europa orientiert hatten, ging es Góis nun auch um die Verständigung mit Völkern anderer Kontinente.Im Jahr 1533 bot König Johann III. Góis den prestigereichen und einträglichen Posten des Schatzmeisters der Lissaboner \"Casa da India\" an, der Kopfstelle der portugiesischen Handelskontore weltweit. Doch Góis wollte lieber seine humanistischen Studien vertiefen. Außerdem mißfiel ihm das Intrigenspiel am Lissaboner Hof. Also bat er den König, ihn zum Studium zu entlassen. Johann III. zeigte freundliches Interesse an den Humanisten, fragte Góis sogar über Luther und Melanchthon aus und ließ ihn ziehen. Auf Einladung des Erasmus kam Góis 1534 für einige Monate nach Freiburg im Breisgau, wohin sich Erasmus zurückgezogen hatte. Der vorsichtige Gelehrte riet seinem Schüler, \"von den Sekten weder gut noch schlecht zu sprechen\". Doch Góis korrespondierte weiter ganz unbefangen mit Melanchthon und machte sogar neue Bekanntschaften mit Persönlichkeiten der Reformation: Er traf den Straßburger Reformator Martin Bucer und sprach in Genf mit Guillaume Farel, Vorgänger und Wegbereiter des Jean Calvin. Zu den Genfer Erneuerern ging Góis allerdings schnell auf Distanz. Wie Erasmus konnte auch er nicht verstehen, warum der Protestantismus die göttliche Vorbestimmung so stark hervorhob und vom menschlichen freien Willen abgrenzte. Er wollte seine Studien an einer deutschen Universität fortsetzen, doch sein Mentor riet ihm ab: Zu gefährlich. Góis ging an die italienische Universität Padua, wo Erasmus Freunde hatte. Von dort aus unternahm er Reisen durch Italien und Süddeutschland. Der nicht mehr ganz junge Student verkehrte viel mit Niederländern und Deutschen. Aus seinen Kontakten mit Protestanten machte er keinen Hehl. Aber er traf auch italienische Kardinäle und sogar Ignacio von Loyola, der gerade dabei war, den Jesuiten-Orden zu gründen.1538 heiratete Góis eine Niederländerin, die Schwester eines Stubengenossen aus Padua. Johanna van Hargen vereinigte, wenn man den Briefen von Góis' Freunden Glauben schenken darf, alle denkbaren Vorzüge: Sie war schön, gebildet, reich und aus bester Familie. Allerdings aus einer streng katholischen, die Gois' freimütigen Umgang nicht gerade schätzte. Das Paar siedelte in die Universitätsstadt Löwen im flämischen Brabant über. Dort veröffentlichte Góis 1539 einen Bericht über eine Episode des portugiesischen Abenteuers in Indien: Ein Jahr zuvor hatten sich die Portugiesen in Díu an der Westküste des indischen Subkontinents, gegen eine zahlenmäßig weit überlegene türkisch-arabische Streitmacht behauptet und den Belagerungsring um die Stadt gesprengt. Dieser Zusammenstoß zweier expansiver Mächte beschäftigte die europäische Phantasie gewaltig. Kein Wunder, daß Góis' Buch, das für damalige Begriffe recht sachlich geschrieben war und auch dem Kriegsgegner positive Züge zubilligte, starkes Interesse fand und sofort auf Italienisch und Deutsch übersetzt wurde. Nur kurze Zeit später offenbarte Góis seine philosophisch-theologische Botschaft: Glaube, Religion und Sitten der Äthiopier hieß das Buch, das auf Gesprächen basierte, die Góis bei seinem Lissabon-Aufenthalt 1533 mit einem Gesandten des äthiopischen Kaisers, einem Mönch namens Zagazabo, geführt hatte. Die Beschreibung von Riten und Bräuchen der äthiopischen Christen verband er mit brisanten Thesen: Alle Christen teilten den gleichen Glauben und die gleiche Taufe; sie sollten sich daher gegenseitig mit Barmherzigkeit und christlicher Liebe behandeln. Die Kontroversen um bestimmte Eigenheiten und Traditionen seien fruchtlos. Zitierte Góis wirklich nur den Zagazabo, wie er vorgab, oder benutzte er einen Kunstgriff,um den streitenden Konfessionen einen Spiegel vorzuhalten? Brach er nicht Tabus, wenn er als Katholik die Äthiopier verteidigte und gleichzeitig ketzerische oder heidnische Merkmale ihrer religiösen Praxis beschrieb: Priesterehe, Sabbat, Beschneidung, Wiedertaufe?Góis' Buch erschien in Löwen und Paris und löste lebhafte Diskussionen aus. Die Jesuiten verurteilten das Buch scharf. Aus seiner Heimat Portugal erfuhr Góis die deutlichste Abfuhr: Der Kardinal Heinrich, Bruder des Königs, ließ das Buch verbieten. Der Zagazabo sei ein Ketzer, schrieb der Kardinal nach Löwen. Aber den Góis halte man natürlich weiterhin für einen guten Christen, da er sich ja nur als \"treulicher Übersetzer\" aus dem Portugiesischen ins Lateinische betätigt habe.... Die Warnung war deutlich. Es erstaunt daher nicht, daß Góis für seine nächste Schrift kein religiöses Thema wählte. Aber wieder riskierte er es, sich zwischen Stühle zu setzen. Góis warf in einer Streitschrift dem berühmten Baseler Geographen Sebastian Münster vor, die wirtschaftliche und kulturelle Bedeutung der iberischen Halbinsel herunterzuspielen. Góis wies Münster Irrtümer und Oberflächlichkeiten nach. Auf Góis' Kritik an Münster reagierten manche seiner deutschen Freunde verschnupft. Auf einen tadelnden Brief von Johann Jakob Fugger antwortete Góis überschwänglich, daß er \"Deutschland, Land und Leute, immer wie eine Gottheit verehrt\" habe. Doch ging er auf Distanz zu den Lutheranern, als diese mit der Kirchenspaltung Ernst machten und 1542 den ersten Bischof ernannten. Wie ein Abschiedsgruß liest sich Góis' Einschätzung, daß Melanchthon eine \"geistige Säule Deutschlands\" und Europas sei, wenn er sich doch nur nicht so viel mit Glaubensdingen beschäftigen würde ...Im Sommer 1542 erreichte die Löwener eine Schreckensnachricht. Vom Niederrhein her marschierte ein flämischer Söldnerführer, der im Dienst des französischen Königs den Habsburgerkaiser Karl V. bekämpfen sollte, mit einem Heer auf Löwen zu. Góis, ohne jede militärische Erfahrung, wurde zum Hauptmann der bewaffneten Studenten gewählt. Bald nach Beginn der Belagerung wurde Góis in das Lager des feindlichen Kommandanten geschickt, um ihn zum Abzug zu überreden. Aus ungeklärten Gründen machten die Löwener plötzlich einen Ausfall, während Góis sich noch im feindlichen Lager aufhielt. Die verwirrten Söldner nahmen Reißaus, aber sie schleppten Góis als Gefangenen mit bis in die nordfranzösische Pikardie. In der geretteten Stadt Löwen stellte Góis' Frau Johanna van Hargen mutig die Ratsherren zur Rede. Aber die zeigten wenig Interesse für das Schicksal des \"Ausländers\", der sich für ihre Stadt eingesetzt hatte. Johanna van Hargen schmiedete daher auf eigene Faust einen Plan, mit Hilfe französischer Studenten ihren Mann aus der Gefangenschaft zu befreien. Doch die ängstlichen Löwener Stadtväter verhinderten das Vorhaben. Nach vierzehn Monaten Gefangenschaft wurde Góis schließlich gegen Zahlung eines hohen Lösegeldes, das Johanna van Hargen selbst aufbringen mußte, freigelassen. Die Begeisterung des Rückkehrers für die Stadt Löwen war begreiflicherweise abgekühlt.1545 entschloß sich Góis nach langem Zögern, nach Lissabon zurückzugehen. Er hatte ein Angebot des Königs Johann III. erhalten, Lehrer des Thronfolgers zu werden. Doch mit seiner Familie in Lissabon angekommen, mußte er feststellen, daß die Jesuiten erfolgreich gegen seine Ernennung intrigiert hatten. Der König übertrug Góis schließlich die Leitung des Staatsarchivs. Zu den Pflichten des Archivars gehörte auch die Aufarbeitung der jüngeren Geschichte Portugals. Góis verfaßte Chroniken über die Regierungszeit der beiden Vorgänger Johanns III., Johann II. und Manuel I. Obwohl er im allgemeinen die Konventionen respektierte, denen er als Hofchronist unterworfen war, konnte er sich doch manche kritische Andeutung nicht verkneifen. So machte er sich mächtige Feinde. Gefährlicher noch: Zweifel an seiner christlichen Standfestigkeit wurden laut. Die Vertreibung der Juden aus Portugal im Jahre 1495 und die Verfolgung sogenannter \"neuer Christen\", christlich getaufter Juden, beschrieb Góis so schonungslos, daß der zeitgenössische Leser die Mißbilligung des Autors erahnte. Noch in Löwen hatte Góis in einer seiner Schriften den Beitrag der Juden zu Kultur und Wissenschaften in Portugal und Spanien ausdrücklich gewürdigt. Damit verließ er das Terrain des Historikers und äußerte sich zu delikaten Fragen seiner Gegenwart. Denn selbst unter dem leidlich toleranten König Johann III. wurden die \"neuen Christen\" schikaniert und bespitzelt. Was Góis nicht davon abhielt, \"neue Christen\" in seinem Haus zu empfangen. Auch Ausländer, darunter Protestanten, gingen bei ihm aus und ein. Góis intervenierte mehrmals bei Hof und bei der Verwaltung Lissabons zugunsten deutscher Kaufleute. \"Er is den deutschen serre zugethan, wywohl er ein portegysser geboren und hoch vom adel met Namen Domianus Gossen\", schrieb der Kaufmann Johann von Pelken in einem Brief nach Köln. Manche Lissabonner nannten ihn mit einer Mischung aus Bewunderung und Mißtrauen den \"fidalgo flamengo\", den flämischen Edelmann, wohl auch wegen seiner Frau, die sich bis zu ihrem Tod 1567 regelmäßig niederländische Bücher kommen ließ.Die Nachrichten, die Góis von seinen weitgereisten Gästen aus seiner ehemaligen brabantischen Wahlheimat erhielt, wurden immer schlechter. Die religiöse Unterdrückung in Flandern und Brabant löste einen Aufstand aus. Den Bildersturm in Gent und Antwerpen beantwortete der spanische Besatzer, der Herzog von Alba, mit grausamen Sanktionen. Auch in Portugal faßte die Inquisition schärfer zu, nachdem der junge König Sebastian 1568 die Regierung übernommen hatte. Sebastian stand unter dem Einfluß fanatischer Jesuiten. Er verlor sich in überspannte und verklemmte Frömmelei, träumte vom Ruhm des Kreuzritters gegen die Ungläubigen.Góis wurde im April 1571 verhaftet und vor das Gericht der Inquisition gestellt. Die Anklage lautete auf lutherische Ketzerei. Unmittelbarer Anlaß der Verhaftung war eine Äußerung im Bekanntenkreis: Góis hätte gesagt, daß die Lutheraner, wenn man sie nur nach Portugal hereinließe, sogar den Kardinal von ihren Ansichten überzeugen würden. Allerdings fanden die Inquisitoren keine Zeugen. Der ebenfalls inhaftierte Arzt und \"neue Christ\" Alvaro Fernandes weigerte sich standhaft, Góis zu belasten. Also griffen die Inquisitoren auf älteres Material zurück, besonders die Aussagen eines Jesuiten und Studienkollegen des Góis aus seiner Zeit in Padua. Góis wußte, daß es um seinen Kopf ging. Plausibel klingende Argumente waren nun wichtiger als die reine Wahrheit. So tastete Góis Punkt für Punkt der Anklage ab: Ja, er habe in seiner Antwerpener Zeit einige der Thesen Luthers geteilt. So habe er zum Beispiel die Ablaßpraktiken verurteilt und die individuelle Beichte als überflüssig empfunden. Aber damals sei er noch sehr jung gewesen und theologisch ungebildet. Ja, er sei auf der Durchreise bei Luther und Melanchthon in Wittenberg gewesen. Er habe dort auch einem Gottesdienst beigewohnt. Aber Luthers Predigt habe er nur zum Teil verstanden, da er ja nur des \"Niederdeutschen\" und nicht des \"Oberdeutschen\" mächtig gewesen sei. Ja, er habe auch noch von Padua aus mit Wittenberg Briefe gewechselt. Doch habe er ausschließlich mit Melanchthon korrespondiert, weil er den für einen gemäßigten Mann gehalten habe, der die Einheit der Kirche bewahren wolle. Italienische Kirchenfürsten hätten ihn bestärkt, seine Kontakte aufrechtzuerhalten. Von Luther habe er in Padua nur noch einen einzigen Brief erhalten, und den habe er ungelesen vernichtet. Er sei ein Schüler des Erasmus, der sich ja deutlich von Luther distanziert habe und gegen die Spaltung der Kirche eingetreten sei. Auf die Frage nach seinen Kontakten mit Ausländern in Lissabon antwortete Góis ganz unbefangen: \"Ich bin allen Fremden gut, weil ich selber Reisender in vielen Gegenden gewesen bin und dort immer sehr gute Gesellschaft gefunden habe.\"Im Oktober 1572 erging das Urteil. Góis wurde exkommuniziert und zu lebenslanger Haft verurteilt. Dem drohenden Todesurteil entging er, da er, so das Gericht, \"versöhnungsfähig\" sei. Offenbar erhielt der Erkrankte bald darauf die Erlaubnis, in sein Geburtshaus in Alenquer zurückzukehren, wo er am 30. Januar 1574 starb. Eine rätselhafte Schädelverletzung gab Anlaß zu Spekulationen, Góis sei ermordet worden. Moderne Historiker halten allerdings einen Unfall für wahrscheinlicher.Vier Jahre nach Gois' Tod erlebte Portugal sein nationales Debakel: Ein wahnwitziger Kriegszug des Königs Sebastian in die marrokanische Wüste endete mit dem Tod des Königs und fast aller Soldaten des kleinen portugiesischen Landheeres in der Schlacht bei Alcácer Qibir. 1580 rückte ein spanisches Heer unter dem Herzog von Alba in Portugal ein, um das Land zu annektieren. Die Schriften des Damiao de Góis aber wurden noch Jahrzehnte später an den verschiedensten Orten Europas neu aufgelegt, in Frankfurt am Main und Venedig, in Wittenberg und Paris, in Rostock und London.LITERATUR:Marion Ehrhardt, A Alemanha e os descobrimentos portugeses, Lisboa 1989Francisco de Faria, Estudos bibligràficos sobre Damiao de Góis e a sua epoca, Lisboa 1977Elisabeth Feist Hirsch, Damiao de Góis.

            " BT don't you have any better work to do? Please, do not teach me that my purposes are just simple futilities. I just gave you what I know about these adjectives. And then you came and you do not want to argue at all. You just give some facts which google shows. All right, it is obvious that '''Slovenian''' is much more used nowadays in electronic media. I can't change this, yes. But as you're new herein you might be at least fair enough to discuss the subject first and then change everything that does not suit you. You still did not give me any explicit proof of some expert about this term. You say that I am the only homeland '''Slovene''' that you have ever encounteed. I do NOT refuse the adjective or noun '''Slovene''' becoming an archaic form. I've just said it is still more familiar to me (and you accused me that this is my own fashion...). And consider what have  and  said. I think that becoming '''Slovene''' an archaic form is your invention. Who says that? I still believe that both terms are equally relevant no matter of your pseudo grammatical examinations. How can you be so sure that '''Slovenian''' will become undisputed standard? Yes University of Ljubljana really uses '''Slovenian''' instead of '''Slovene'''. This has without no doubt surprised me. The Fran Ramovš Institute of '''Slovenian''' Language of Scientific Research Centre of '''Slovenian''' Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC-SAZU) also uses '''Slovenian'''. I guess they know why and I believe this might be the HARDEST proof that you might be right. Here's one excerption from the search of '''Slovene''' at their Corpus Laboratory: ''\"DELO, 22. julija 1999, sentence 774 in context:\"'' ''\"Naslednja beseda je »Slovene« (izgovori se podobno kot kratica za Slovenija-vino »Slovin«), ki se razlaga kot slovenski, slovenščina, Slovenec. Oxford Dictionary v Microsoftovi Encarti pa pozna tudi za nas daleč boljšo in primernejšo obliko »Slovenian« namesto dvoumnega »Slovene«. Tudi Komac-Škerlj: Slovene(!) English Modern Dictionary navaja poleg »Slovene« tudi »Slovenian«, vendar se o priporočeni obliki ne izreka, kar se mi zdi slabo. Vsekakor bi morali dati prednost obliki »Slovenian«, kadar prevajamo pridevnik »slovenski«, morda celo takrat, ko govorimo o narodnosti.\"'' Trans: (The next word is '''»Slovene«''' ( it is pronounced similar as an abbreviation for Slovenia-vino  '''»Slovin«'''), and is explained as Slovene, Slovene language, Slovene  a native). Oxford Dictionary in Microsoft Encarta knows for us far better and more convenient form of '''»Slovenian«''' instead of ambiguous '''»Slovene«'''. Also Komac-Škerlj: Slovene(!) English Modern Dictionary alleges beside '''»Slovene«''' also '''»Slovenian«''', but it does not declare for the recommended form, what is bad for me. By all means we should preferentially use the form '''»Slovenian«''' when we translate the adjective '''»Slovenian«''' and perhaps even then when we talk about nationality.)The search of '''Slovene''' gives 'just' 42 and of '''Slovenian''' gives 242 words. So again '''Slovenian''' wins. Another one: ''\"Za Slovence v Pensilvaniji se formalno uporabljajo izrazi \"Slovenian, Slovene and Windish\". Prva dva se uporabljata izmenično, enakovredno, medtem ko se izraz \"Windish\" uporablja skoraj izključno za Slovence iz Prekmurja, ki živijo v Bethlehemu v Pensilvaniji.\"'' Trans: (For Slovenes in Pennsylvania terms of '''\"Slovenian''', '''Slovene''' and '''Windish\"''' are used. First two are used in turn, equally, meanwhile the term '''\"Windish\"''' is used almost exclusively for Slovenes from the Transmuraland (Prekmurje), who live in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania). What do you mean that '''Slovenes''' are still catching up to the rest of the world? The simple answer to this was given by Chuck who said that he never meet noone who uses '''Slovenian'''. I am not disregarding the links you gave about '''Slovene''' companies. I have them in mind. But I believe that you're one of those funny quibblers who would spend the whole day trying to persuade such the unbelievers as I AM. On the other side you do not consider the facts I gave you from those great English dictionaries (You can also check about the Doubleday Dictionary at google if you want. It is mentioned many times as a good resource). In my opinion English dictionaries are still more relevant than the entire internet. Another fact is this: \"Veliki angleško-slovenski slovar\" of authors Grad, Škerlj, Vitorovič from 1997 uses both terms, but it has '''Slovenian''' as a noun just for the language ''slovenščina'' not for the natives ''Slovenec''. So where did you find that '''Slovenian''' should also be used as a noun for natives? Just on the net? Please, check some other dictionaries if you have them... Anton Grad's \"English-Slovene dictionary\" from 1965 has both terms as adjective and as noun on the other side, but he chose the fist one for the name of the dictionary  not \"English-Slovenian dictionary\"... I think that as you've already changed so many adjectives and nouns to your definitive form, you haven't done much. If I follow you I have to use Cilli instead of Celje, since I haven't met no native English speaker who uses Celje and so on, and so on. The same with Carinthia|Karantania and such. Thank you anyway for your insignificant service. And finally not to forget. I think that we still in the relevance to '''Slovene'''/'''Slovenian''' have to distinguish between American English and British English  but, no, you're throwing everything in one basket. But, hey I am not confused  you are. I simply use just one term  Slovene, and you use another one and teach other to use the same... Continue in this way and you'll get very far.

            "AFAIK there are some differences in Baden-Württemberg; at least in my home muncipality of Gundelfingen there was some discussion if it shouldn't apply for town status with almost 12.000 inhabitants.The ''Gemeindeordnung für Baden-Württemberg''  says in §5(2) Die Bezeichnung »Stadt« führen die Gemeinden, denen diese Bezeichnung nach bisherigem Recht zusteht. Die Landesregierung kann auf Antrag die Bezeichnung »Stadt« an Gemeinden verleihen, die nach Einwohnerzahl, Siedlungsform und ihren kulturellen und wirtschaftlichen Verhältnissen städtisches Gepräge tragen. Wird eine Gemeinde mit der Bezeichnung »Stadt« in eine andere Gemeinde eingegliedert oder mit anderen Gemeinden zu einer neuen Gemeinde vereinigt, kann die aufnehmende oder neugebildete Gemeinde diese Bezeichnung als eigene Bezeichnung weiterführen.So it seems that you're right and there is no difference between towns and muncipalities (Gemeinden). The only difference I found is regarding \"Große Kreisstädte\" (more than 20.000 inhabitants) and \"Stadtkreise\", which both have not a \"Bürgermeister\", but an \"Oberbürgermeister\".

Of course for every unit vector you get (in general) different values, so you do not have just one number like in the scalar case but a whole bunch of numbers (a continuum) parametrised by the unit vectors in n dimensions (actually only the direction counts, u and -u give the same value)Now comes the big trick.

So Charles the Fat is the only exception.  Otherwise, I'd say that 843 is probably the best date for the creation of \"France\", although, of course, it was still called \"West Francia\" for some time after that.  I'd note, though, that ''Nations before Nationalism'' by John Armstrong, suggests that the origins of a nation called \"France\" should be dated at some point between 911 and 987, especially the latter part of the period, when there were Emperors in Germany of a dynasty junior to the Carolingians ruling France.  France's lengthier maintenance of the Carolingians meant that it could see itself as utterly politically separate from Germany with its ridiculous new dynasty calling itself emperors, and thus extricated itself from the grip of Roman universalism.  (Not sure if that made sense).  Anyway, I would say that \"France\" originated between 843 and 987, although, of course, it was a feudal mess for most of that time.  05:46 26 May 2003(UTC)well  except for Louis the German, Louis the Bavarian, Louis the Child, Arnulf ... and Charles the Fat isn't an interloper  he was invited in!  Still, I agree with Armstrong that it's a pain.  ANd I like using the Capetans  but the numbering doesn't work that way ... ugh! Well, yes, but I was thinking of the Kings of West Francia.  None of the ones you mention ruled over West Francia/France.  Yeah, I know Charles the Fat was invited in.  But they kicked him out right quick.  That's what you get for inviting in a king known as \"the Fat\".  Although Louis the Fat was a pretty good king, I suppose.   06:44 26 May 2003 (UTC)So then why is Edward James' extensive published work all about the origins of today’s France coming from Clovis? (Edward James, \"The Origins of France: Clovis to the Capetians 500-1000.\")  How does \"politically separate from Germany\" come into this discussion? Germany didn't exist for another 1000 years. According to the Britannica Concise Encyclopedia:'''''Merovingian Dynasty: Frankish dynasty considered the first French royal house.'''''  According to BBC 1:\"'''''The Merovingian Dynasty was the first major royal dynasty of what would eventually become France.'''''\"See also: '''MEROVINGIAN DYNASTY: Medieval France''': An Encyclopedia , eds. W. Kibler and G. Zinn. New York: Garland Publishing, 1995.  This Encyclopedia states: \"'''''The Merovingians are considered to be the \"first race\" of French kings'''''\"Triton  your sources are 1) very general, and 2) support what I've said. D'oh!  I explained why the \"are considered\" part exists in the details.  Also, \"what would '''eventually''' become France  i.e., it wasn't at the time.  JAmes we've done ad nauseam.  The last one  anyone who uses \"first race\" is clearly revising a really old (like late 19th c.) text for a modern version.  The language alone should tell you that the analysis is historically suspectUnfortunately Ms. Kemp, the facts are clear and precise by all reputable sources that the Merovingians were in fact the first monarchs of France. The changes in borders as a result of war make them no different than any other anywhere. You should perhaps study a little more on the Merovingians, in particular Clovis I and the monarchy. Unless you can come up with documented proof of something different that the numerous above totally  credible sources (and I can get more) who clearly and precisely state the Merovingians as French monarchs, please do not remove them from this list on your unfounded whims. ''How singularly amusing!  I teach college history and my research specialty is the Franks, although I focus more on the Carolingians.   Despite that, I'm guessing I might just have read more, and more advanced works, on the subject than you and your cronies.  For example, right now, I'm reading  Nira Gradowicz-Pancer, \"De-gendering female violence  Merovingian female honour as an 'exchange of violence'\"in '''Early Medieval Europe''', v. 11, no. 3 (2002).  Maybe I should just read old encyclopedias instead?'' Look, given the Encyclopedia Britannica (EB) and Britannica Concise Encyclopedia (BCE), which source would you take as a more accurate reference? Clearly EB because the latter has clearly stated '''Concise'''. The quote in EB states the Merovigians was '''traditionally''' reckoned only, in contrast to BCE. According to '''Le Petit Larousse illustre''', eds. Patrice Maubourguet et al.. Paris: Larousse, 1996, the entry Merovingians clearly states, \"'''Merovingiens''', nom donne a la premiere dynastie de rois francs. Elle n'apparut dans l'histoire qu'avec Chlodion (m. v. 460), qui fut roi de Cambrai, et Childeric Ier (m. v. 481), qui fut roi de Tournai et dont il n'est pas sur qu'il ait ete le fils de Chlodion. En fait, la fondateur de la dynastie fut Clovis Ier (m. en 511). Le dernier Merovingien, Childeric III, roi en 743, fur enferme en 751 dans un monastere par Pepin le Bref, fondatuer des Carolingiens.\"The entry is translated as:'''Merovingians''', name of the first dynasty of '''Frankish''' kings. They did not appear in history until the appearances of Chlodion (died ca 460), who was the king of Cambrai, and Childeric I (died ca 481), who was the king of Tournai. Thus it is not sure if Childeric I was the son of Chlodion. In fact the founder of the dynasty was Clovis I (died 511). The last Merovingian, Childeric III, king in 743, was bounded in 751 inside a monastry by Pepin the Short, founder of the Carolingians.Convinced? kt2I don't think triton is worth arguing with.  He/she is obviously not listening to anything we say.   18:46 26 May 2003 (UTC)While I would never put down anyone’s creditials, I would certainly not make degrading remarks like calling people’s honest efforts obtuness, misrepresentations or lies as Ms. Kemp did to a user on Talk:Clovis I. This is the Internet where identity theft is a real problem and purported credentials mean little. However, based on her input in the Clovis I article, I would say she may not have read much on early France and certainly not the Merovingians. I managed to stumble through universities but won’t make claims in an intended encyclopedia I can’t substantiate. That kind of thing is for discussion forums. Therefore, if Encyclopedia Britannica, or all the other facts I gave aren’t good enough for her, she should do as I already asked and provide the appropriate references that contradicts James, Fouracre and Gerberding and others. Perhaps she could could give everyone the ISBN number for these references and that of her own published authorative works on the subject.  Encyclopedia Brittanica does not support you.  It says the Merovingians are ''traditionally reckoned'' the first Kings of France.  That's not the same thing as saying they are Kings of France.  The article, at present, does say that the Merovingians are traditionally considered Kings of France.  You are purposefully misconstruing other sources to support your claim, when, in fact, they do not.  19:08 26 May 2003 (UTC)I believe I mentioned that I hold your sources in high regard, and that I believe you have miscontrued them, as you have the EB per KT2 above.  Also, I did add other sources, with ISBN numbers  another book by James, and two by Geary.  Unless they got reverted in one of triton's reverts!  ANd unfortunately I stand by the rest  if Triton's attempts are honest, he would enter into the discussion  clearly that isn't happening. I'm the one in the discussion with facts, you have yet to provide even one. You have done nothing but assert your unfounded, undocumented opinions. You drove away user: Ericd, Olivier, and others on the matter of France and you continue to delete factual information that contradicts your continuining diatribe of unfounded opinions. Please deal with facts. And I repeat, please don't demean honest contributors. It only tells everyone exactly who you are. In all my life, I have never met a qualified, educated person who gets there point across by deleting proofs that don't suit them or by insulting the person they disagree with.Triton, what's your response on my evidents then? the coin in Clovis I was not dated and here is a  1996 coin that clearly states Clovis is the king of Franks. Again, the quote in EB states the Merovigians was '''traditionally''' reckoned only. BTW I seconded what john has said - Triton is just quoting \"evidences\" without taking careful accounts at them. kt2I never said Clovis was not King of the Franks. What I said was what James said: The Origins of France is Clovis and he was crowned King in Reims.Yes, but I think the question is, Does James say he was crowned King of France?  I can't imagine that he does.  Also, what is his source?  Since Clovis was king of the Franks long before his conversion, was this part of his entry into the Church?  It seems likely (after all, coronatins are Christian ceremonies), but it isn't mentioned in Gregory  I just checked.  ANyway, I think you may be to emotionally involved to be reading what we are saying.  JHKAll of a sudden, golly gosh, maybe he was crowned. Why don't you read about the origin of the Divine Right of Kings. And, reinstate my facts in Clovis I. Also, try to control your emotions and not irrationally remove important information that others might wish to read. It belittles Wikipedia to vandalize articles and to say degrading things about other contributors. You don't seem to understand  let me clarify.  Presumably the coronation at Rheims was done by Remegius, the Bishop.  This type of coronation only happens in a Christian context.  I don't know that there was a pagan equivalent.  Sorry, Triton, but I am just trying to figure out what you mean.  The questions are perfectly reasonable and are meant to further cooperation.  I would ask them of a colleague, so why do you find them insulting? JHKSo, start by reinstating everything into Clovis I, someone I do indeed know something about. Then, explain James' title, explain Britannica assertions (who it is claimed on Wikipedia is the greatest source), explain all the others and refute THEM, don't worry about me or any ideas I might have. Provide proofs to refutre all these respected sources and I will gladly accept it. But, so far, (I repeat), you only keep expressing opinions, no facts. My Gosh, you sometime ago even deleted Clovis' burial place!  No one here claims Brittanica is the greatest source  it's just a source we legally borrow from to save work!  And please stop asking me to do what I've done here and elsewhere, if you'd take the time to read through old discussions.  And unfortunately, sometimes, things get deleted because it's easier than picking through and re-writing wholesale.  IF I removed Clovis' burial place, I probably removed it because it was writted in a context that was misleading. JHKJust go back and reinstate the FACTUAL map and my text. Thank you. Here is the first line at Wikipedia - Encyclopædia BritannicaEncyclopædia Britannica is the most prestigious encyclopedia in the English language. Its articles are commonly considered most accurate, reliable and well-written.Now, I repeat:Britannica Concise Encyclopedia:'''''Merovingian Dynasty: Frankish dynasty considered the first French royal house.'''''  Is this enough or do you now wish to delete some of Wikipedia's article on the Britannica? You know, Ms. Kemp, when others see you continually delete facts without justification, it really does cause a moment's hesitation. But, I have every confidence you can prove Britannica wrong. So please do. This is getting tiresome.   20:21 26 May 2003 (UTC)64.228.30.93 - look, which one of the two sources would you take as the more accurate, Encyclopædia Britannica or Britannica '''Concise''' Encyclopedia ?Defintely Encyclopædia Britannica, right? Now, the entry at EB states Frankish dynasty (AD 476–750) traditionally reckoned as the “first race” of the kings of France.. John states above \"Encyclopedia Brittanica does not support you. It says the Merovingians are ''traditionally reckoned'' the first Kings of France.  That's not the same thing as saying they are Kings of France.\"They were not kings of France, and thus not French monarchs. Get it? kt2Excuse my bluntness but this endless talk is getting tiresome. - kt2I agree, this is getting quite tiresome.  Perhaps to refocus the discussion, we could try to work on the language to make it less offensive to those who still see the Frankish Kings as \"Kings of France\", without surrendering to them.  I present the sentence:\"This view is somewhat problematic in layman's terms, however, in part due to the existence of centuries-old tradition, generally based on royal propaganda often generated by rivals for the French throneI would suggest that the last phrase be deleted - it is a centuries old tradition, based, I would imagine, on numerous factors.  Among these is royal propaganda from the Capetians, and that can be mentioned, but this seems a bit confrontational, as it stands.  20:58 26 May 2003 (UTC)The Merovingians were not Kings of \"France\", but niether where the Carolingians. Nevertheless both are \"traditionally reckoned\" as Kings of France. If we have the Carolingians here it makes no sense to exclude the Merovingians. Maybe there should be two articles: List of Frankish monarchs and List of French monarchs, with the former listing the Merovingian Kings of Neustria and Austrasia and Carolingians and the later picking up with the Capetians. I think that would be sensible.  On the other hand, I think a  better date for the cut off would be Verdun in 843.  Western Francia was the political entity that was the direct predecessor to modern France, and, further, if we didn't do that there would be considerable confusion on the \"Frankish Monarchs\" page after 843 - Charles the Bald and Louis the German's vassals' oaths in French and German seems a good enough cut off to me.  Of course, that means that the monarchs numbered Charles I and Louis I of France would not be listed in the monarchs of France article.  21:08 26 May 2003 (UTC)I seconded it. Under the entry of ''France''' at the Larousse I quoted above,....'''Les Carolingiens''' 768-814: .... 843-987  Charles le Chauve, '''premier roi de France.'''.... (i.e. Charles the Bald, '''first king of France''').not to beat it over the head, but that's why we originally included the Carolingians.  And there are already pages and lists for the Ms and Cs JHKGive me a break. First Ms. Kemp ignores my prooof then deletes it, thern deletes a map from Clovis in 511 that shows FRANCE as clear as a bell then tells Brion Vibber my map is a copyright violation blah blah blah. It isn't but of course SHE deleted it, abusing her sysop powers. How much do you guys need spelled out. The medallion of Clovis I labeling him as King of France, his crowning was King of what? Toledo? Read and study history. Clovis formed France. There is no record anywherte on the planet that states the day the territory became offically “FRANCE.” The rulers evolved as did its name. Look at the 511 map. England wasn't called England when Ethelred (whoever) showed up, nor were its borders anywhere near precise. Remember a place called Wales? But, we list him as a King of England. He lived, reigned, died there. Clovis I is as much or more King of France than the first Kings of England cvan be labeled and more King of France than most all the other losers who followed and lost territory every day of the week until Henri IV. There is no argument amongst historians: James titled his book \"ORIGINS OF FRANCE - Clovis etc.” for a reason. Why is this discussion going on. I just put up a new 870 map. Look at it and the 511 map. See France? It is almost what the place is today. Old Clovis did a heck of a job. I’m tired of Ms. Hemp going on and on and on without ever providing one shred of evidence to support her absurd theories. And that is all they are, HER THEORIES and she has to delete my facts to cover her claims. The Carolingians replaced the Merovingians as what over what. Rulers of the territorty we call France. And when the Capetians took over it was justy the same long line of territorial rulers. ALL are Kings of the territory we now call England and of France. Now, please insert the Merovingians here and if you want, by all means explain the lines and territories for the past 2,000 years and how or what they were called. Then go to the list of British Kings and give the same explanation.Whatever kt2I'm no historian so I'll refrain from comment on the substance of these disputed articles, but let's get one thing straight - ''nobody'' has abused their sysop powers. The map has ''not'' been deleted - it has been removed from the article and listed on Wikipedia:Votes for deletion. This is absolutely the proper procedure. Unless somebody can show that it is PD or GFDL as explained at Image:ClovisDomain.jpg, it will indeed be deleted, because we do not want to breach any copyrights. Also, contary to what you said before, it is ''not'' only sysops who can revert pages; please see Wikipedia:How to revert a page to an earlier version. Triton, you have presented nothing even vaguely resembling \"proof\".  You have cited a) the title of a book, which could mean all kinds of things, and likely doesn't mean what you say it does; and b) various encyclopedia articles that don't mean what you say they mean.  And not only Ms. Kemp has disagreed with you.  kt2 and myself have also been presenting you with plenty of explanations as to why the early Frankish kings ought not be considered Kings of France.  If anyone is not paying attention to what other people say it is you.  Your argument in all situations is a) these authorities say what I do [they don't]; b) The Franks ruled what is now France, therefore they were Kings of France [in which case Constantine XI would be surprised to learn that he was a Turk.]; and c) Ms. Kemp is somehow violating sysop powers by doing things that any user can do.  This is pretty weak.  23:31 26 May 2003 (UTC)S/he is not listening. kt2Not only do I listen, I read too. Do you? What part of \"History of France: Clovis to the Capetians\" do you not understand when you read it? And, what great wisdom do you demonstraste by saying  ''and likely doesn't mean what you say it does''? Forgive me, but that kind of statement is belitting. Suggest you read my Clovis I additions of today. Not what minor semblance is left after Ms. Kemp deleted FACTS without proof solely because FACTS debunked her line of theories. Read my full article. The whole history of ALL European kings claiming a \"Divine Right TO RULE\" is predicated on King Clovis of France. As author James and Britannica said (want more for the list?) Clovis I, a Merovingian ruler, was King of France. The title of the damned book is \"Origins of France: Clovis to the Capetians\".  Do you think we're going to be fooled by something like that?  This does not imply that James es saying that Clovis was a King of France.  Please, supply a quote from within the James book in which Clovis is called \"King of France.\"  Britannica does ''not'' call him a King of France.  It says in the Clovis article: \"king of the Franks  and ruler of much of Gaul from 481 to 511, a key period during the transformation of the Roman Empire into Europe.\"  It does say that later French people saw him as the first King of France, but so does this article as it stands now.  So: give me a quote from the James book that actually says Clovis ''was'' King of France, not merely that he was later considered to have been a King of France, and then we can discuss this further.  If you just keep referring back to using wrong versions of the title of the book, and inaccurate glosses of Britannica, I'm going to ignore you.  23:53 26 May 2003(UTC)I do read pal. Let's take it logically. You said a while ago, \"I '''never''' said Clovis was not King of the Franks.\" and now you say Clovis was a king of France. What are you achieving by a double-negative statement ? So is or isn't Clovis a king of Franks by that statement? If you intend to mean Clovis was a king of Franks, then you are contradicting your king of France statement. If you intend to mean Clovis was a king of France, you are contradicting your \"Clovis was not King of the Franks\" statement. You are contradicting yourself either way.Although there are two other possible ways: Clovis was the King of the Franks and the King of the France, and Clovis was neither the KIng of Franks nor the King of France. These two statements were not mentioned in any of your statements so I am sure you didn't mean that.Last but not least, I am researching sinology online so I might be a little late on my reply but that doesn't mean I didn't read comments here pal. kt2Hi all  I think we've all gotten a bit tired.  I've asked for a neutral party to step in, read through the pages in question, and maybe freeze contributions to the articles for a week.BTW, as I mentioned at Clovis I, I thought that much of what Triton added was good information, but that I hed a gut feeling that it was cribbed too closely from James, and that it would make a good chunk of the article fall under the category of plagiarism  something we can't afford.  Triton hasn't really offered to show that it's not, so I plan to get copies of the relevant books from the library (if they are in) sometime this week.  If it is more than plagiaristic paraphrasing, I'll put lots of it back.  As it was, though, I checked some of it against Gregory of Tours' ''History of the Franks'', the main primary source for this period, and some of the re-writing actually changed chronology, etc. I don't think that was intentional  probably more a way of not plagiarizing  but it doesn't make sense to add in stuff haphazardly. JHKHmm...do we have the right to revert information simply because we have a ''gut feeling'' that it might be plagiarism?  I'm not so sure.  Certainly, Triton's contributions, for the most part, improved the Clovis article, assuming that they're not plagiarized.  A question: to what extent is paraphrasing plagiarism?  I know for some of the articles I've written I've looked at Britannica for reference, and ended up using bits and pieces of information from it.  For instance, if Britannica says that Lord Salisbury had a difficult childhood, and I say something similar, worded differently, is that plagiarism?  Given that it's basically a piece of information, how distant does it have to be?  00:12 27 May 2003 (UTC)um.... It's hard to draw the line. I am not an expert so I wish a legal guru or lawyer can shed some light on this isuue. ky2OK, I've protected the page for the time being. I suggest that all parties work for a mutally acceptable compromise, perhaps by choosing a different page title. Sysops, please do not make non-minor edits to the page while it is protected.   00:20 27 May 2003 (UTC)You don't need to protect it from me. Ms. Kemp hits Puff the Magic Dragon and my hard work and proofs vanish. I don't care wehat title you use just remember Mr. Vibber says this is to be a true encyclopedia so when someone clicks here it better not be too far off from Encyclopedia Britannica or other credible websites. Right now this page says \"''golly, gosh, the Carolingians aren't really aren't French kings but I'm so nice I'll let you list them here''\". And the Merovingians are nowhere to be found on the list of Kings who ruled over what at some point we statred calling \"France\". This folks, makes a joke of Wikipedia. Next, you have to treat the List of British monarchs exactly the samne way as the French. An encyclopedia must be consistent. The date England became England is unknown, just like France, the English King's territory changed frequently too. Good Lord, Bonnie Prince Charlie, King of Scotland (he hoped) had London within his grasp! Mary, Queen of Scotland claimed the throne of England as well and Philip of Spain and on and on.  Just FYI, Julie has not used her sysop powers in any way regarding this article. Anyone, including anonymous users, can revert to an earlier version by viewing the history, selecting a revision, editing and saving it. I will not get involved in the discussion so as to maintain neutrality.  00:39 27 May 2003 (UTC)The big problem that Franch historians have been trying to explain away for a long time, Triton, is that even though the Carolingians (and even more the M's) ruled over (what is now) France, french they were definitely not. They hung on to their Germanic heritage rather subbornly. So French historians came up with a myth: the Francs are extict, absorbed, therefore we can claim them retroactively as 'french'. The fact that in the extreme North of France there was still a handful speaking (what evolved from) their tongue was a nuisance htat needed to be removed by degrading it to this horrible unworthy 'patois' of 'flamand' Successive French governments were quite effective in ridiculing and cajoling it to death.Not that the Germans were any better to what is admittedly my mothertongue: Dutch is obviously a german dialect, after all the Franks were Germans, nichtwahr? (That we Franks tried to civilizes these barbarians is easily forgotten.In the name of Europe, can we PLEASE stop this nonsense. The Franks were Europeans and pretty darned good ones too. This Frank therefore refuses to claim Karel de Grote as my past king. Je vous invite tous a faire la meme choseJcwfVrai. Il me fatigue aussi, mais Tritons continue a poser son faux raisons. kt2Non! C'est pas vrai! Pour tous les ans.... I agree with Jcwf, this is nonsense.  Triton: England wasn't England before the Anglo-Saxons invaded, surely?  In general lists of Kings of England start with Egbert, the first King of Wessex to be accepted as \"High King\" of all the Anglo-Saxons.  The use of the term \"King of England\" seems to be later, though.  But, in any event, the Anglo-Saxons are basically the English, in a way that you can't say that the Franks are the French (what with them speaking a Germanic language, and such).  As far as it goes, I'd suggest:1) A page with Kings of the Franks, listing them up through the Treaty of Verdun;2) This page start with Charles the Bald, noting that Charles I is Charlemagne and Louis I is Louis the Pious, without them actually being part of the \"official\" list.  843 is a fairly natural starting point, since it's when the Kingdom that directly evolved into modern France came into being.  It obviates the problem of Pepin the Short obviously not being particularly more a King of France than Childeric, but explains how the numbering system works.  It doesn't involve the messiness of trying to list all the late Carolingians one page.3) It be clearly explained on this page that in French national tradition, the Merovingian and early Carolingian Kings of the Franks were considered to be Kings of France (and, for the early Carolingians, also Kings of Germany, or what not).What do people think?  03:32 27 May 2003 (UTC)The List of Frankish Kings already exists. SO, basically, kind of what's here already, but adding that the Carolingians are also part of the history of Germany and German national tradition (whatever that is)  and then a list that starts off with  \"for numbering purposes, Charlemagne is considered CI and Louis the Pious Louis I, and then just continue with western Carolingians (with C the Fat?)?  Hmmm  I would like to see the numbers in parens after the whatchamacallits - nicknamey things.  May take some consideration, but it might work as I understand it ... Yes, basically.  In terms of Cognomens, I think \"Charles II the Bald\", \"Louis II the Stammerer\", and so forth, work fairly well, although \"Charles the Bald (Charles II)\", \"Louis the Stammerer (Louis II)\" would also work.   04:06 27 May 2003 (UTC)I think that the later just sounds better, since really they are one or the other in conversation, and most contemporary authors don't even use numbers for the  Carolingians with cognomena.  FOr example, McKitterick in ''Frankish Kingdoms'', Innes in ''State and Society in the Early Middle Ages''.  I think even Pierre Riché in Les Carolingiens Oh  and in German, it's almost always just the cognomenAlright, then that sounds fine to me.  On the other hand, for the Capetians with cognomens, I think it should come after the number: \"Louis VI the Fat\", \"Philip IV the Fair\", and so forth.  04:26 27 May 2003 (UTC)How about a table format:Dynasty or House Rulers (with Roman numerals)Rulers (with cognomens)ReignsRemarksCarolingiansCharles IICharles the Bald847-877....kt2Very pretty!Yeah, that's pretty nice.  I wish I knew how to make tables (  Anyway, this way we can even get \"Louis the Well-Loved\", and so forth.  Although, to be honest, I can't think of any other Bourbon monarchs who had cognomes.  (  06:11 27 May 2003 (UTC) I'm not sure that linking to Charles II is a good idea - it's a disambiguation page... -/ Perhaps in layman terms you can tell me how the Britannica Concise Encyclopedia states: '''Merovingian Dynasty: Frankish dynasty considered the first French royal house''' - means the Merovingian dynasty are NOT the first French royal house. Unless I am totally stupid, when one makes a list of French monarchs it usually starts with the first French royal house, doesn’t it? Next, go to http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article?eu=386306 where it states: '''\"He (Clovis) is traditionally regarded as the founder of the French monarchy and the original French champion of the Christian faith.'''\" Is this not clear enough too?This creation of two lists, one called List of Frankish Kings is a message that says Franks are not French and the Merovingian are not rulers of France. That contradicts all existing authorities on this subject. Lets not go in circles here. What makes the list of British monarchs different than the French list? Both were not called England or France 1500 years ago, both have had their territorial borders changed frequently and under most very king. So why would not some of these purported British kings be segregated to another list with a disambiguation page? And, when you read: '''MEROVINGIAN DYNASTY: Medieval France: An  Encyclopedia''', eds. W. Kibler and G. Zinn. New York: Garland Publishing, 1995.  This Encyclopedia states: \"The Merovingians are considered to be the \"first race\" of French kings.\"  By race, they are saying the race of Franks ruled over many other distinct races in France. Read your French history: “Groups of people not connected by dialect, philosophy, or political commonality, but labeled under one name by the Romans as ‘’Germanic tribes’’, soon began taking over parts of Gaul, blocking other barbarians coming in great numbers from the north and the east during the 5th century.”But,  THEY ARE FRENCH KINGS. What more do you need from?  Clovis is recognized by ALL qualified scholars and sources as the first because of the territory he united. Please look at the map on Clovi I article, the one Ms. Kemp did not want you to see. Question, why do you argue a point here? Why not produce a reputable source that contradicts the many scholars I have quoted. And, note Ms. Kemp has provided no rebuttal proofs, only more talk about her “ideas” and deleting of my facts accompanied by degrading remarks. Study Manchester University’s work by Paul Fouracre and Richard A. Gerberding titled:  '''Late Merovingian France: ''' History and Hagiography, 640-720. Note, please it is titled Merovingian France, not Merovingian China.  Or does this mean Merovingian NOT France?Next study “Francia” then you will understand that the territory between modern-day France and Germany, and south to Central Italy, became known as Francia.  West Francia is France and 1,400 years later East Francia was named Germany. The Franks settled in West Francia long before Clovis. But,  Clovis lived, worked, fought, made love, had children, and died and is buried in Paris, West Francia. That makes Clovis a West Francian doesn’t it? Yes, he conguered and ruled over parts of Germany and if one wishes to list the history of Germany (although the country as we know it is only 100 years old) then by all means list Clovis as one of its ruler/conguerors. But, Clovis did not come riding in on his horse from Berlin and conqueror West Francia. As I said in the Clovis I article that Ms. Kemp deleted in order to hide facts and proofs that she was wrong,  the Franks lived in Toxandria.Honestly, this is going too far. But I care about the quality at Wikipedia and will not let Ms. Kemp intimidate me as she did others and drive me away. I just don’t understand why anyone at Wikipedia would want to contradict all other encyclopedias and scholars and place opinions without any supporting proof into an article and label it as fact. It will only take one reputable scholar to look at it and label Wikipedia as a joke. Please stop talking here in circles and deal with facts. Is that asking too much in an encyclopedia?For the benefit of those dropping in on this discussion, I’ve saved time and added the following from the WikiEN-L archive who responded to Ms. Kemp on this subject. '''Stan Shebs wikien-l@wikipedia.org'''Sun, 25 May 2003 17:36:18 -0400Merovingians as not-French is definitely in the radical rethinkcategory, and it may be a decade, or a generation, or even longer,before it comes to be generally accepted.  Until then, trying toedit Wikipedia based on the assumption that the assertion is trueis going to be hard; you're going against an army of editors whoare backed by a horde of published authorities with reputationsmuch higher than your own.StanI will point out, so there is no doubt: there is no discussion or witings anywhere of any kind by any credible authority that attempts to deny/change or rethink that the Merovingians were not French. The only person who ever raised this issue was someone who logged in under the user name Ms. J. Hoffman-Kemp at www.wikipedia.org. Triton, 1) Ms. Hoffman Kemp is so obviously not the only person who has been saying this that you are surely not being honest in your statements here; 2) you have no sources to back you up, besides Stan's comment to the listserve, which hardly counts.  As far as the difference between \"British Monarchs\" and \"French Monarchs\" - Britain is a purely geographical term.  it was used to refer to the region before the Romans, and is still used today.  Therefore, all medieval kings on the island are British kings.  \"France\", on the other hand, is a geographical term derived from the name of a people.  That people is the \"French\".  Of course, the name French derives from Frank, but the Franks were not French - they were a Germanic people.  Until there can be said to be a ''Romance-speaking'' people who call themselves ''French'' (as opposed to Gauls, or gallic), I don't think you can say there was a France.  16:54 27 May 2003 (UTC)First, never make accusations of dishonesty in a discussion. It is that type of conduct they ban people for and I certainly don't appreciate it. If I lie, or abuse you, please state it. I will be the first to apologize, unlike Ms. Kemp. Second, I provided mutitudes of sources. But, you are saying that James doesn't know what he is talking about and should change the title of his book to '''History of a \"Piece of Rock & Mud in Europe\": Clovis to the Capetians''' instead of '''History of France: Clovis to the Capetians'''. I don't profess to be an expert on the subject but I believe in Encyclopedia Britannica and when Wiki says it is ther foremost authority (whatever) then I agree or do we change that article to say Britannica is less than reliable? And I repeat what I said before as just one SOURCE (again that we here at Wiki say is absolutely reliable):Britannica Concise Encyclopedia states: '''Merovingian Dynasty: Frankish dynasty considered the first French royal house''' - means exactly what it says. Next, go to http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article?eu=386306 where it states about Clovis I  '''\"He (Clovis) is traditionally regarded as the founder of the French monarchy and the original French champion of the Christian faith.'''\" Is this not clear enough too? Now, sir. In a Wikipedia List of French monarchs should we not list the '''\"founder of the French monarchy\"''' as Britannica claims Clovis to be?By the way: \"''Therefore, all medieval kings on the island are British kings''\" - really? That is amazing. So William the Conqueror is British? Canute was British? William III of Orange was British. All were kings of the whole island. Sorry, but a lot of Scots and Welsh folk would take great exception to that. \n",

I did not put translation as I did for Matt, as you speak french -) thanks.this is precisely why we banned him that we are having problemsbecause he is not very motivated to quit us.

Now, I do not look at en meta matters, not even on undeletion matters, which I help to set up, for last time I undeleted an article, it was immediatement deleted again, and I was told I did not respect the rules, rules which keep changing ;-). I just do articles, and that is all; simpler. I work at ecology at . Not very quickly -) I initially intended to have it done by last monday -). Good nite. Ant''yes, it was. Just one thing, I prefer that science is linked in the first paragraph, as it is important to say that it is first of all a science. Perhaps can we link the greek word, or do an invisible link behind \"study\" ?The other thing is that I am thinking of removing part of para 1, because I think it is unecessarily confusing and not very good. I am glad you made some corrections here and there.I go read the paragraph quietly now (hopefull, if pp is not back again) -)yes, it was all very well done. I thank you very much. I just fixed some links -) You were very helpful.I feel a bit depressed right now, because I just agreed for the isps of Chattering to be written to, and I fear it goes a bit against my principles.

Here's a quote of his from his current ICTY trial(): \"Sa osloncem na unutrašnje saveznike, nacionalističko-separatistička jezgra uz dominantno prisustvo onih snaga koje su poražene u Drugom svetskom ratu.
